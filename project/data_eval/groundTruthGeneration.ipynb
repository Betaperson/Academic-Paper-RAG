Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\\\beta$ levels.

This we achieve by\\nsubtracting from its Wehrl entropy, the maximum Wehrl entropy attainable by any\\nclassical state that has same randomness as measured in terms of von-Neumann\\nentropy. We obtain analytic expressions of NC for most of the states, in\\nparticular, all pure states and Gaussian mixed states. However, the evaluation\\nof NC for the non-Gaussian mixed states is subject to extensive numerical\\ncomputation that lies beyond the scope of the current work. We show that, along\\nwith the states generated under single NC-inducing operations, also for the\\nbroader class of states that are generated under multiple NC-inducing\\noperations, our quantification enumerates the NC consistently.\\n',\n",

       "  'inputs': {'abstract': '  We describe a novel weakly supervised deep learning framework that combines\\nboth the discriminative and generative models to learn meaningful\\nrepresentation in the multiple instance learning (MIL) setting. MIL is a weakly\\nsupervised learning problem where labels are associated with groups of\\ninstances (referred as bags) instead of individual instances. To address the\\nessential challenge in MIL problems raised from the uncertainty of positive\\ninstances label, we use a discriminative model regularized by variational\\nautoencoders (VAEs) to maximize the differences between latent representations\\nof all instances and negative instances. As a result, the hidden layer of the\\nvariational autoencoder learns meaningful representation. This representation\\ncan effectively be used for MIL problems as illustrated by better performance\\non the standard benchmark datasets comparing to the state-of-the-art\\napproaches. More importantly, unlike most related studies, the proposed\\nframework can be easily scaled to large dataset problems, as illustrated by the\\naudio event detection and segmentation task. Visualization also confirms the\\neffectiveness of the latent representation in discriminating positive and\\nnegative classes.\\n',\n",

One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking\\nAnalysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their\\ndiffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA\\nfollows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement\\n(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\\\\propto t$).

They represent the\\nuncertainty in the initial conditions by an ensemble which incorporates\\ninformation coming from the physical model with the latest observations.\\nHigh-resolution numerical weather prediction models ran at operational centers\\nare able to resolve non-linear and non-Gaussian physical phenomena such as\\nconvection. There is therefore a growing need to develop ensemble assimilation\\nalgorithms able to deal with non-Gaussianity while staying computationally\\nfeasible. In the present paper we address some of these needs by proposing a\\nnew hybrid algorithm based on the Ensemble Kalman Particle Filter. It is fully\\nformulated in ensemble space and uses a deterministic scheme such that it has\\nthe ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) instead of the stochastic EnKF as a\\nlimiting case. A new criterion for choosing the proportion of particle filter\\nand ETKF update is also proposed. The new algorithm is implemented in the COSMO\\nframework and numerical experiments in a quasi-operational convective-scale\\nsetup are conducted. The results show the feasibility of the new algorithm in\\npractice and indicate a strong potential for such local hybrid methods, in\\nparticular for forecasting non-Gaussian variables such as wind and hourly\\nprecipitation.\\n',\n",

In this paper, a Distributed Antenna Power\\nBeacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where these antennas are uniformly distributed\\non a circle is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation\\nlevel (SERL) requirement. In this model, three key questions are intended to be\\nanswered: 1) With the SERL, what is the performance of the harvested power at\\nthe users ? 2) How do we configure the parameters to maximize the efficiency of\\nWPT? 3) Under the same constraints, does the DA-PB still have performance gain\\nthan the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB)? First, the minimum antenna height of\\nDA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation\\npower density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL\\npublished by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the\\nclosed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user\\nin the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order\\nto maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed\\nantennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the\\ntypical value $2$ and $4$. For comparison, the CA-PB is also analyzed as a\\nbenchmark. Simulation results verify our derived theoretical results. And it is\\nshown that the proposed DA-PB indeed achieves larger average harvested DC power\\nthan CA-PB and can improve the efficiency of WPT.\\n',\n",

The fluid domain is modeled with a lattice Boltzmann\\nrepresentation, the particles and rigid parts are modeled with a discrete\\nelement representation, and the deformable solid domain is modeled using a\\nLagrangian mesh. The main issue of this work, since separately each of these\\nmethods is a mature tool, is to develop coupling and model-reduction approaches\\nin order to efficiently simulate coupled problems of this nature, as occur in\\nvarious geological and engineering applications. The lattice Boltzmann method\\nincorporates a large-eddy simulation technique using the Smagorinsky turbulence\\nmodel. The discrete element method incorporates spherical and polyhedral\\nparticles for stiff contact interactions. A neo-Hookean hyperelastic model is\\nused for the deformable solid. We provide a detailed description of how to\\ncouple the three solvers within a unified algorithm. The technique we propose\\nfor rubber modeling/coupling exploits a simplification that prevents having to\\nsolve a finite-element problem each time step. We also develop a technique to\\nreduce the domain size of the full system by replacing certain zones with\\nquasi-analytic solutions, which act as effective boundary conditions for the\\nlattice Boltzmann method. The major ingredients of the routine are are\\nseparately validated. To demonstrate the coupled method in full, we simulate\\nslurry flows in two kinds of piston-valve geometries.

Concomitantly, the local density itself\\nfluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local\\ndensity variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective,\\na model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is\\nintroduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a\\ncertain threshold value, $\\\\rho_{\\\\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle\\nrearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period\\n($\\\\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy\\ncluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict\\nthat with compression (increasing average density $\\\\rho$) at a fixed\\ntemperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the\\nclusters, $\\\\xi$, diverges as $\\\\xi\\\\sim(\\\\rho_{\\\\rm c}-\\\\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is\\nthe spatial dimensionality. This $\\\\xi$ measures the average persistence length\\nof the steric constraints in blocking the rearrangement motions and is\\ndetermined by the subsystem density. Additionally, with decreasing $T$ at a\\nfixed $\\\\rho$, the length scale diverges in the same manner as $\\\\xi\\\\sim(T-T_{\\\\rm\\nc})^{-2/d}$, for which $\\\\rho$ is identical to $\\\\rho_{\\\\rm c}$ at $T=T_{\\\\rm c}$.\\nThe exponent describing the diverging length scale is the same as the one\\npredicted by some theoretical models and indeed has been observed in some\\nsimulations and experiments. However, the basic mechanism for this divergence\\nis different; that is, we do not invoke thermodynamic anomalies associated with\\nthe thermodynamic phase transition as the origin of the growing length scale.\\nWe further present arguements for the cooperative properties based on the\\nclusters.\\n',\n",

In this paper, we\\nintroduce two non-parametric approaches to establish the fragility curves\\nwithout employing the above assumption, namely binned Monte Carlo simulation\\nand kernel density estimation. As an illustration, we compute the fragility\\ncurves for a three-storey steel frame using a large number of synthetic ground\\nmotions. The curves obtained with the non-parametric approaches are compared\\nwith respective curves based on the lognormal assumption. A similar comparison\\nis presented for a case when a limited number of recorded ground motions is\\navailable. It is found that the accuracy of the lognormal curves depends on the\\nground motion intensity measure, the failure criterion and most importantly, on\\nthe employed method for estimating the parameters of the lognormal shape.\\n',\n",

       "  'inputs': {'abstract': '  Long-term load forecasting plays a vital role for utilities and planners in\\nterms of grid development and expansion planning. An overestimate of long-term\\nelectricity load will result in substantial wasted investment in the\\nconstruction of excess power facilities, while an underestimate of future load\\nwill result in insufficient generation and unmet demand. This paper presents\\nfirst-of-its-kind approach to use multiplicative error model (MEM) in\\nforecasting load for long-term horizon. MEM originates from the structure of\\nautoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model where conditional\\nvariance is dynamically parameterized and it multiplicatively interacts with an\\ninnovation term of time-series. Historical load data, accessed from a U.S.\\nregional transmission operator, and recession data for years 1993-2016 is used\\nin this study. The superiority of considering volatility is proven by\\nout-of-sample forecast results as well as directional accuracy during the great\\neconomic recession of 2008. To incorporate future volatility, backtesting of\\nMEM model is performed. Two performance indicators used to assess the proposed\\nmodel are mean absolute percentage error (for both in-sample model fit and\\nout-of-sample forecasts) and directional accuracy.\\n',\n",

We argue that information sharing can benefit from well- defined use\\nmodels, threat models, well-understood risk by mea- surement and robust\\nscoring, well-understood and preserved pri- vacy and quality of indicators and\\nrobust mechanism to avoid free riding behavior of selfish agent. We call for\\nusing the differential nature of data and community structures for optimizing\\nsharing.\\n',\n",

Using over 144 combinations\\nof ${m}^*$ and $I^*$, we comprehensively map out the parameter space covering\\nvery heavy ($m^* > 10$) to very buoyant ($m^* < 0.1$) particles. The entire\\ndata collapses into two scaling regimes demarcated by a transitional Strouhal\\nnumber, $St_t \\\\approx 0.17$. $St_t$ separates a mass-dominated regime from a\\nregime dominated by the particle's moment of inertia. A shift from one regime\\nto the other also marks a gradual transition in the wake-shedding pattern: from\\nthe classical $2S$~(2-Single) vortex mode to a $2P$~(2-Pairs) vortex mode.\\nThus, auto-rotation can have a significant influence on the trajectories and\\nwakes of freely rising isotropic bodies.\\n\",\n",

These boundary conditions are devised based on the\\nproperties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability\\nproperty ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the\\nenergy balance will not cause the total energy of the N-phase system to\\nincrease over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary conditions are very\\neffective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems. The\\nreduction consistency property ensures that if some fluid components are absent\\nfrom the N-phase system then these N-phase boundary conditions will reduce to\\nthose corresponding boundary conditions for the equivalent smaller system. Our\\nnumerical algorithm for the proposed boundary conditions together with the\\nN-phase governing equations involves only the solution of a set of de-coupled\\nindividual Helmholtz-type equations within each time step, and the resultant\\nlinear algebraic systems after discretization involve only constant and\\ntime-independent coefficient matrices which can be pre-computed.

       "  'inputs': {'abstract': '  We present a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that is\\nbased on radio signals and the association of specular multipath components\\n(MPCs) with geometric features. Especially in indoor scenarios, robust\\nlocalization from radio signals is challenging due to diffuse multipath\\npropagation, unknown MPC-feature association, and limited visibility of\\nfeatures. In our approach, specular reflections at flat surfaces are described\\nin terms of virtual anchors (VAs) that are mirror images of the physical\\nanchors (PAs). The positions of these VAs and possibly also of the PAs are\\nunknown. We develop a Bayesian model of the SLAM problem including the unknown\\nMPC-VA/PA association. We represent this model by a factor graph, which enables\\nthe use of the belief propagation (BP) scheme for efficient marginalization of\\nthe joint posterior distribution. The resulting BP-based SLAM algorithm detects\\nthe VAs associated with the PAs and estimates jointly the time-varying position\\nof the mobile agent and the positions of the VAs and possibly also of the PAs,\\nthereby leveraging the MPCs in the radio signal for improved accuracy and\\nrobustness of agent localization. A core aspect of the algorithm is BP-based\\nprobabilistic MPC-VA/PA association. Moreover, for improved initialization of\\nnew VA positions, the states of unobserved potential VAs are modeled as a\\nrandom finite set and propagated in time by means of a \"zero-measurement\"\\nprobability hypothesis density filter. The proposed BP-based SLAM algorithm has\\na low computational complexity and scales well in all relevant system\\nparameters. Experimental results using both synthetically generated\\nmeasurements and real ultra-wideband radio signals demonstrate the excellent\\nperformance of the algorithm in challenging indoor environments.\\n',\n",

Of the thousands of\\nextra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that\\ntransit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to\\ntransit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature\\nof ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is\\nitself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M.

Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme\\nultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,\\nleading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet\\nlargely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host\\nstar.\\n\",\n",

Our\\napproach breaks the input program into parts and relates the statistics of the\\ndifferent parts, under the smoothing process.

The\\nresistance measurement shows a reduction of ~2.5% for the bilayer specimen as\\ncompared to 1.3% for Ni80Fe20 (50 nm) on oxide specimen for an out-of-plane\\napplied magnetic field of 3T.

Further, these spectra are often multi-valued at some frequencies. Our\\nmain result is a multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform that solves such\\nproblems associated with the conventional GFT. Using algebraic properties of\\nCartesian products, the proposed transform rearranges 1-D spectra obtained by\\nthe conventional GFT into the multi-dimensional frequency domain, of which each\\ndimension represents a directional frequency along each factor graph. Thus, the\\nmulti-dimensional graph Fourier transform enables directional frequency\\nanalysis, in addition to frequency analysis with the conventional GFT.\\nMoreover, this rearrangement resolves the multi-valuedness of spectra in some\\ncases. The multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform is a foundation of novel\\nfilterings and stationarities that utilize dimensional information of graph\\nsignals, which are also discussed in this study. The proposed methods are\\napplicable to a wide variety of data that can be regarded as signals on\\nCartesian product graphs.

The\\nproposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that\\nguarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we\\ndemonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and\\nadvance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second\\nnetwork. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling\\napplications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids\\nwith different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and\\ncompression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are\\ngenerated up to 700x faster than traditional CPU solvers, while achieving\\ncompression rates of over 1300x.\\n',\n",

Sampling from the $\\\\sim$3000-parameter joint\\nposterior using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we find $H_0$ = (72.72 $\\\\pm$ 1.67)\\n${\\\\rm km\\\\,s^{-1}\\\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ when applied to the outlier-cleaned Riess et al.\\n(2016) data, and ($73.15 \\\\pm 1.78$) ${\\\\rm km\\\\,s^{-1}\\\\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with SN\\noutliers reintroduced. Our high-fidelity sampling of the low-$H_0$ tail of the\\ndistance-ladder likelihood allows us to apply Bayesian model comparison to\\nassess the evidence for deviation from $\\\\Lambda$CDM. We set up this comparison\\nto yield a lower limit on the odds of the underlying model being $\\\\Lambda$CDM\\ngiven the distance-ladder and Planck XIII (2016) CMB data. The odds against\\n$\\\\Lambda$CDM are at worst 10:1 or 7:1, depending on whether the SNe outliers\\nare cut or modeled, or 60:1 if an approximation to the Planck Int.

The number of users is assumed to be unknown\\nto each user. A stochastic setting is first considered, where the rewards on a\\nchannel are the same for each user. In contrast to prior work, it is assumed\\nthat the number of users can possibly exceed the number of channels, and that\\nrewards can be non-zero even under collisions. The proposed algorithm consists\\nof an estimation phase and an allocation phase.

The regret guarantees hold for any number of users and channels,\\nin particular, even when the number of users is less than the number of\\nchannels. Next, an adversarial multi-user MAB framework is considered, where\\nthe rewards on the channels are user-dependent. It is assumed that the number\\nof users is less than the number of channels, and that the users receive zero\\nreward on collision. The proposed algorithm combines the Exp3.P algorithm\\ndeveloped in prior work for single user adversarial bandits with a collision\\nresolution mechanism to achieve sub-linear regret. It is shown that if every\\nuser employs the proposed algorithm, the system wide regret is of the order\\n$O(T^\\\\frac{3}{4})$ over a horizon of time $T$. The algorithms in both\\nstochastic and adversarial scenarios are extended to the dynamic case where the\\nnumber of users in the system evolves over time and are shown to lead to\\nsub-linear regret.\\n',\n",

This interloper exhibits a\\nvariable colour within a range that is broadly consistent with local small\\nbodies such as the P/D type asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and dynamically excited\\nKuiper Belt Objects. 1I/'Oumuamua appears unusually elongated in shape, with an\\naxial ratio exceeding 5:1. Rotation period estimates are inconsistent and\\nvaried, with reported values between 6.9 and 8.3 hours. Here we analyse all\\navailable optical photometry reported to date. No single rotation period can\\nexplain the exhibited brightness variations. Rather, 1I/'Oumuamua appears to be\\nin an excited rotational state undergoing Non-Principal Axis (NPA) rotation, or\\ntumbling. A satisfactory solution has apparent lightcurve frequencies of 0.135\\nand 0.126 hr-1 and implies a longest-to-shortest axis ratio of 5:1, though the\\navailable data are insufficient to uniquely constrain the true frequencies and\\nshape. Assuming a body that responds to NPA rotation in a similar manner to\\nSolar System asteroids and comets, the timescale to damp 1I/'Oumuamua's\\ntumbling is at least a billion years. 1I/'Oumuamua was likely set tumbling\\nwithin its parent planetary system, and will remain tumbling well after it has\\nleft ours.\\n\",\n",

       "  'inputs': {'abstract': '  Purpose: Basic surgical skills of suturing and knot tying are an essential\\npart of medical training. Having an automated system for surgical skills\\nassessment could help save experts time and improve training efficiency. There\\nhave been some recent attempts at automated surgical skills assessment using\\neither video analysis or acceleration data. In this paper, we present a novel\\napproach for automated assessment of OSATS based surgical skills and provide an\\nanalysis of different features on multi-modal data (video and accelerometer\\ndata). Methods: We conduct the largest study, to the best of our knowledge, for\\nbasic surgical skills assessment on a dataset that contained video and\\naccelerometer data for suturing and knot-tying tasks. We introduce \"entropy\\nbased\" features - Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Cross-Approximate Entropy\\n(XApEn), which quantify the amount of predictability and regularity of\\nfluctuations in time-series data. The proposed features are compared to\\nexisting methods of Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Cosine Transform\\n(DCT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), for surgical skills assessment.\\nResults: We report average performance of different features across all\\napplicable OSATS criteria for suturing and knot tying tasks. Our analysis shows\\nthat the proposed entropy based features out-perform previous state-of-the-art\\nmethods using video data. For accelerometer data, our method performs better\\nfor suturing only. We also show that fusion of video and acceleration features\\ncan improve overall performance with the proposed entropy features achieving\\nhighest accuracy. Conclusions: Automated surgical skills assessment can be\\nachieved with high accuracy using the proposed entropy features. Such a system\\ncan significantly improve the efficiency of surgical training in medical\\nschools and teaching hospitals.\\n',\n",

All return to pre-burst levels within 10kyr.\\nIn the case of an ordered magnetic field, effects depend strongly on the field\\norientation. The upper bound in this case is with a largely coherent field\\naligned along the line of sight to the supernova, in which case TeV-PeV cosmic\\nray flux increases are 10^4; in the case of a transverse field they are below\\ncurrent levels. We suggest a substantial increase in the extended effects of\\nsupernovae on Earth and in the lethal distance estimate; more work is\\nneeded.This paper is an explicit followup to Thomas et al.

       "  'inputs': {'abstract': '  We study large-scale kernel methods for acoustic modeling in speech\\nrecognition and compare their performance to deep neural networks (DNNs). We\\nperform experiments on four speech recognition datasets, including the TIMIT\\nand Broadcast News benchmark tasks, and compare these two types of models on\\nframe-level performance metrics (accuracy, cross-entropy), as well as on\\nrecognition metrics (word/character error rate). In order to scale kernel\\nmethods to these large datasets, we use the random Fourier feature method of\\nRahimi and Recht (2007). We propose two novel techniques for improving the\\nperformance of kernel acoustic models. First, in order to reduce the number of\\nrandom features required by kernel models, we propose a simple but effective\\nmethod for feature selection. The method is able to explore a large number of\\nnon-linear features while maintaining a compact model more efficiently than\\nexisting approaches. Second, we present a number of frame-level metrics which\\ncorrelate very strongly with recognition performance when computed on the\\nheldout set; we take advantage of these correlations by monitoring these\\nmetrics during training in order to decide when to stop learning. This\\ntechnique can noticeably improve the recognition performance of both DNN and\\nkernel models, while narrowing the gap between them. Additionally, we show that\\nthe linear bottleneck method of Sainath et al. (2013) improves the performance\\nof our kernel models significantly, in addition to speeding up training and\\nmaking the models more compact. Together, these three methods dramatically\\nimprove the performance of kernel acoustic models, making their performance\\ncomparable to DNNs on the tasks we explored.\\n',\n",

Our sample is selected from the\\n3D-HST/CANDELS survey, which provides the complementary data to estimate\\nLy$\\\\alpha$ equivalent widths ($W_{Ly\\\\alpha}$) and escape fractions ($f_{esc}$)\\nfor our galaxies. We find both quantities to anti-correlate with M$_*$,\\nstar-formation rate (SFR), UV luminosity, and UV slope ($\\\\beta$). We then model\\nthe $W_{Ly\\\\alpha}$ distribution as a function of M$_{UV}$ and $\\\\beta$ using a\\nBayesian approach. Based on our model and matching the properties of typical\\nLyman break galaxy (LBG) selections, we conclude that the $W_{Ly\\\\alpha}$\\ndistribution in such samples is heavily dependent on the limiting M$_{UV}$ of\\nthe survey. Regarding narrowband surveys, we find their $W_{Ly\\\\alpha}$\\nselections to bias samples toward low M$_*$, while their line-flux limitations\\npreferentially leave out low-SFR galaxies. We can also use our model to predict\\nthe fraction of Ly$\\\\alpha$-emitting LBGs at $4\\\\leqslant z\\\\leqslant 7$. We show\\nthat reported drops in the Ly$\\\\alpha$ fraction at $z\\\\geqslant6$, usually\\nattributed to the rapidly increasing neutral gas fraction of the universe, can\\nalso be explained by survey M$_{UV}$ incompleteness.

We do not\\ndetect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or\\nobservational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens\\nconfiguration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate\\nestimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased\\nlow (high). With kinematic constraints, double lenses show bias and intrinsic\\nscatter of 6% and 10%, respectively, while quad lenses show bias and intrinsic\\nscatter of 0.5% and 10%, respectively. For lenses with a reduced $\\\\chi^2 > 1$,\\na power-law dependence of the $\\\\chi^2$ on the lens environment (number of\\nnearby galaxies) is seen. Lastly, we model, in greater detail, the cases of two\\ndouble lenses that are significantly biased. We are able to remove the bias,\\nsuggesting that the remaining biases could also be reduced by carefully taking\\ninto account additional sources of systematic uncertainty.\\n',\n",

We analyze the dynamics of SGD and\\nshow that, indeed, direct computation of the solutions is possible in many\\ncases. We show that a high performing setup used in DNNs introduces a\\nseparation of time-scales in the training dynamics, allowing SGD to train\\nlayers from the lowest (closest to input) to the highest. We then show that for\\neach layer, the distribution of solutions found by SGD can be estimated using a\\nclass-based principal component analysis (PCA) of the layer's input. This\\nfinding allows us to forgo SGD entirely and directly derive the DNN parameters\\nusing this class-based PCA, which can be well estimated using significantly\\nless data than SGD. We implement these results on image datasets MNIST, CIFAR10\\nand CIFAR100 and find that, in fact, layers derived using our class-based PCA\\nperform comparable or superior to neural networks of the same size and\\narchitecture trained using SGD. We also confirm that the class-based PCA often\\nconverges using a fraction of the data required for SGD.

This model takes advantage of extreme learning\\nmachine (ELM) to improve detection efficiency. ELM is the single hidden layer\\nneural network, which is transforming iterative solution the output weights to\\nsolution of linear equations and avoiding the local optimal solution. Moreover,\\nwe rank anomies according to the relationship between samples and the\\nclassification boundary, and then assigning weights for ranked anomalies,\\nretraining the classification model finally. Our method exploits the complement\\ninformation between sub-systems sufficiently, and avoids the influence from\\nimbalance dataset, therefore, deal with various challenges from the cloud\\ncomputing platform. We deploy the privately cloud platform by Openstack,\\nverifying the proposed model and comparing results to the state-of-the-art\\nmethods with better efficiency and simplicity.\\n',\n",

Recent\\nstudies have shown that the composition of the gas phase, which is typically a\\nmixture of vapour and air, has a noticeable effect on the critical Marangoni\\nnumber describing the onset of convection as well as on the observed convection\\npattern. Specifically, as the total pressure or, equivalently, the average\\nconcentration of air is decreased, the threshold of the instability leading to\\nthe emergence of convective rolls is found to increase rather significantly. We\\npresent a linear stability analysis of the problem which shows that this trend\\ncan be readily understood by considering the transport of heat and vapour\\nthrough the gas phase. In particular, we show that transport in the gas phase\\nhas a noticeable effect even at atmospheric conditions, when phase change is\\ngreatly suppressed.\\n',\n",

       " 'inputs': {'abstract': \"  Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease\\nrelated alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can\\nbe made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the\\nsubject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual\\nmeasurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely\\nused, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,\\nis rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of\\ndispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction\\nmethod, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive\\nmodeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically\\naims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite\\nsample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type\\nalgorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic\\nmanner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed\\nas a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are\\nestimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental\\nevaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the\\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on\\nsynthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy\\ncompared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the\\nADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between\\nsubject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers\\nof Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score\\nand Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\\\\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on\\nthe longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when\\nRSM is used.\\n\",\n",
