conditions, a no-penetration vorticity boundary condition, along with a natural

What is the name of the variational autoencoder (VAE) variation used in a non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion method?,aa9061d2,"Title: ACVAE-VC: Non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion with auxiliary classifier variational autoencoder

        Abstract:   This paper proposes a non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion (VC) method
using a variant of the conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) called an
auxiliary classifier VAE (ACVAE). The proposed method has three key features.
First, it adopts fully convolutional architectures to construct the encoder and
decoder networks so that the networks can learn conversion rules that capture
time dependencies in the acoustic feature sequences of source and target
speech. Second, it uses an information-theoretic regularization for the model
training to ensure that the information in the attribute class label will not
be lost in the conversion process. With regular CVAEs, the encoder and decoder
are free to ignore the attribute class label input. This can be problematic
since in such a situation, the attribute class label will have little effect on
controlling the voice characteristics of input speech at test time. Such
situations can be avoided by introducing an auxiliary classifier and training
the encoder and decoder so that the attribute classes of the decoder outputs
are correctly predicted by the classifier. Third, it avoids producing
buzzy-sounding speech at test time by simply transplanting the spectral details
of the input speech into its converted version. Subjective evaluation
experiments revealed that this simple method worked reasonably well in a
non-parallel many-to-many speaker identity conversion task.

How was the accuracy of identifying pregnant women on social media evaluated?,a5429ad3,"Title: Social media mining for identification and exploration of health-related information from pregnant women

        Abstract:   Widespread use of social media has led to the generation of substantial

Social media provides the opportunity to study health-related information about
selected population groups who may be of interest for a particular study. In
this paper, we explore the possibility of utilizing social media to perform
targeted data collection and analysis from a particular population group --
pregnant women. We hypothesize that we can use social media to identify cohorts
of pregnant women and follow them over time to analyze crucial health-related
information. To identify potentially pregnant women, we employ simple
rule-based searches that attempt to detect pregnancy announcements with
moderate precision. To further filter out false positives and noise, we employ
a supervised classifier using a small number of hand-annotated data. We then
collect their posts over time to create longitudinal health timelines and
attempt to divide the timelines into different pregnancy trimesters. Finally,
we assess the usefulness of the timelines by performing a preliminary analysis
to estimate drug intake patterns of our cohort at different trimesters. Our

months from Twitter. Our pregnancy announcement classification technique
achieved an F-measure of 0.81 for the pregnancy class, resulting in 34,895 user

information, such as drug-intake and adverse reactions can be mined from the
data. Our approach to using user timelines in this fashion has produced very
encouraging results and can be employed for other important tasks where
cohorts, for which health-related information may not be available from other
sources, are required to be followed over time to derive population-based
estimates.

Can delayed information about product popularity alter the outcome of adoption trends?,ecf1c3c3,"Title: Hipsters on Networks: How a Small Group of Individuals Can Lead to an Anti-Establishment Majority

        Abstract:   The spread of opinions, memes, diseases, and ""alternative facts"" in a
population depends both on the details of the spreading process and on the
structure of the social and communication networks on which they spread. In
this paper, we explore how \textit{anti-establishment} nodes (e.g.,
\textit{hipsters}) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products.
We consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for
updating node states (which describe which product has been adopted) in which
an adjustable fraction $p_{\rm Hip}$ of the nodes in a network are hipsters,
who choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the
two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by
considering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate
our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters
have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product:
even when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the
simulations, a very small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the
other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this
behavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fraction
on $k$-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our
simulations demonstrate that a time delay $\tau$ in the knowledge of the
product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of
product adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final
distribution of product adoptions. Our simple model and analysis may help shed
light on the road to success for anti-establishment choices in elections, as
such success can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of
anti-establishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on
normal individuals.

What determines the size of glassy clusters? ,b2d25d3f,"Title: Growing length scale accompanying the vitrification: A perspective based on non-singular density fluctuations

        Abstract:   In glass forming liquids close to the glass transition point, even a very
slight increase in the macroscopic density results in a dramatic slowing down
of the macroscopic relaxation. Concomitantly, the local density itself
fluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local
density variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective,
a model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is
introduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a
certain threshold value, $\rho_{\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle
rearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period
($\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy
cluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict
that with compression (increasing average density $\rho$) at a fixed
temperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the
clusters, $\xi$, diverges as $\xi\sim(\rho_{\rm c}-\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is
the spatial dimensionality. This $\xi$ measures the average persistence length
of the steric constraints in blocking the rearrangement motions and is
determined by the subsystem density. Additionally, with decreasing $T$ at a
fixed $\rho$, the length scale diverges in the same manner as $\xi\sim(T-T_{\rm
c})^{-2/d}$, for which $\rho$ is identical to $\rho_{\rm c}$ at $T=T_{\rm c}$.
The exponent describing the diverging length scale is the same as the one
predicted by some theoretical models and indeed has been observed in some
simulations and experiments. However, the basic mechanism for this divergence
is different; that is, we do not invoke thermodynamic anomalies associated with
the thermodynamic phase transition as the origin of the growing length scale.
We further present arguements for the cooperative properties based on the
clusters.

quasi-analytic solutions, which act as effective boundary conditions for the

improve its efficacy in ablating solid tumors. We develop a modeling framework
for tumor ablation, and present the simplest possible model for drug diffusion
in a spherical tumor with leaky boundaries and assuming cell death eventually
leads to ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities
numerically equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends
on both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to the
cell. Higher oxygen availability leads to cell death at lower drug
concentrations. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required for
a cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The
concentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which allows us
to compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can be plotted at
much finer time intervals compared to that of experiments, which is used to
produce a dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture
of the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the diffusion,
leak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is different for different
individuals and tumors, we produce artificial replication data through
bootstrapping to simulate error. While the usual data-driven model with
Sigmoidal curves use 12 free parameters, our mechanistic model only has two
free parameters, allowing it to be open to scrutiny rather than forcing
agreement with data. Even so, the simplest model in our framework, derived
here, shows close agreement with the bootstrapped curves, and reproduces well
established relations, such as Haber's rule.

"How does the scaling factor affect the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of  ALMA observations, particularly in datasets with low precipitable water vapor (PWV)?",d63791e6,"Title: Phase correction for ALMA - Investigating water vapour radiometer scaling:The long-baseline science verification data case study

        Abstract:   The Atacama Large millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) makes use of water
vapour radiometers (WVR), which monitor the atmospheric water vapour line at
183 GHz along the line of sight above each antenna to correct for phase delays
introduced by the wet component of the troposphere. The application of WVR
derived phase corrections improve the image quality and facilitate successful
observations in weather conditions that were classically marginal or poor. We
present work to indicate that a scaling factor applied to the WVR solutions can
act to further improve the phase stability and image quality of ALMA data. We
find reduced phase noise statistics for 62 out of 75 datasets from the
long-baseline science verification campaign after a WVR scaling factor is
applied. The improvement of phase noise translates to an expected coherence
improvement in 39 datasets. When imaging the bandpass source, we find 33 of the
39 datasets show an improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) between a
few to ~30 percent. There are 23 datasets where the S/N of the science image is
improved: 6 by <1%, 11 between 1 and 5%, and 6 above 5%. The higher frequencies
studied (band 6 and band 7) are those most improved, specifically datasets with
low precipitable water vapour (PWV), <1mm, where the dominance of the wet
component is reduced. Although these improvements are not profound, phase
stability improvements via the WVR scaling factor come into play for the higher
frequency (>450 GHz) and long-baseline (>5km) observations. These inherently
have poorer phase stability and are taken in low PWV (<1mm) conditions for
which we find the scaling to be most effective. A promising explanation for the
scaling factor is the mixing of dry and wet air components, although other
origins are discussed. We have produced a python code to allow ALMA users to
undertake WVR scaling tests and make improvements to their data.

What characteristic is demonstrated by the generated music across extended time periods? ,35f285fc,"Title: The challenge of realistic music generation: modelling raw audio at scale

        Abstract:   Realistic music generation is a challenging task. When building generative
models of music that are learnt from data, typically high-level representations
such as scores or MIDI are used that abstract away the idiosyncrasies of a
particular performance. But these nuances are very important for our perception
of musicality and realism, so in this work we embark on modelling music in the
raw audio domain. It has been shown that autoregressive models excel at
generating raw audio waveforms of speech, but when applied to music, we find
them biased towards capturing local signal structure at the expense of
modelling long-range correlations. This is problematic because music exhibits
structure at many different timescales. In this work, we explore autoregressive
discrete autoencoders (ADAs) as a means to enable autoregressive models to
capture long-range correlations in waveforms. We find that they allow us to
unconditionally generate piano music directly in the raw audio domain, which
shows stylistic consistency across tens of seconds.

What are the benefits of high dynamic range (HDR) imaging systems compared to standard dynamic range (SDR) systems?,31c74a75,"Title: High Dynamic Range Imaging Technology

range (SDR) imaging systems. The larger luminance range greatly improve the
overall quality of visual content, making it appears much more realistic and

What kind of techniques are used to construct ascending HNN extensions with unbounded depth? ,ac7ec08d,"Title: Bounded Depth Ascending HNN Extensions and $π_1$-Semistability at $\infty$

        Abstract:   A 1-ended finitely presented group has semistable fundamental group at
$\infty$ if it acts geometrically on some (equivalently any) simply connected
and locally finite complex $X$ with the property that any two proper rays in
$X$ are properly homotopic. If $G$ has semistable fundamental group at $\infty$
then one can unambiguously define the fundamental group at $\infty$ for $G$.
The problem, asking if all finitely presented groups have semistable
fundamental group at $\infty$ has been studied for over 40 years. If $G$ is an
ascending HNN extension of a finitely presented group then indeed, $G$ has
semistable fundamental group at $\infty$, but since the early 1980's it has
been suggested that the finitely presented groups that are ascending HNN
extensions of {\it finitely generated} groups may include a group with
non-semistable fundamental group at $\infty$. Ascending HNN extensions
naturally break into two classes, those with bounded depth and those with
unbounded depth. Our main theorem shows that bounded depth finitely presented
ascending HNN extensions of finitely generated groups have semistable
fundamental group at $\infty$. Semistability is equivalent to two weaker
asymptotic conditions on the group holding simultaneously. We show one of these
conditions holds for all ascending HNN extensions, regardless of depth. We give
a technique for constructing ascending HNN extensions with unbounded depth.
This work focuses attention on a class of groups that may contain a group with
non-semistable fundamental group at $\infty$.

How can  actor-critic contextual bandit methods be made more robust to outliers in mHealth?,06420b80,"Title: Robust Contextual Bandit via the Capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm

        Abstract:   This paper considers the actor-critic contextual bandit for the mobile health

generally assume that the noise in the dynamic system follows the Gaussian
distribution. Those methods use the least-square-based algorithm to estimate
the expected reward, which is prone to the existence of outliers. To deal with
the issue of outliers, we propose a novel robust actor-critic contextual bandit

prevents outliers from dominating our objective. A set of weights could be
achieved from the critic updating. Considering them gives a weighted objective
for the actor updating. It provides the badly noised sample in the critic
updating with zero weights for the actor updating. As a result, the robustness
of both actor-critic updating is enhanced. There is a key parameter in the
capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm. We provide a reliable method to properly set it by
making use of one of the most fundamental definitions of outliers in

In particular, it is possible to remove one percent of weight of edges of any

Our proof is based on a new connection between effective resistance and low

How can changing the physical properties of a drug improve its ability to destroy tumors?,08e1751b,"Title: Modeling of drug diffusion in a solid tumor leading to tumor cell death

        Abstract:   It has been shown recently that changing the fluidic properties of a drug can
improve its efficacy in ablating solid tumors. We develop a modeling framework
for tumor ablation, and present the simplest possible model for drug diffusion
in a spherical tumor with leaky boundaries and assuming cell death eventually
leads to ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities
numerically equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends
on both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to the
cell. Higher oxygen availability leads to cell death at lower drug
concentrations. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required for
a cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The
concentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which allows us
to compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can be plotted at
much finer time intervals compared to that of experiments, which is used to
produce a dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture
of the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the diffusion,
leak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is different for different
individuals and tumors, we produce artificial replication data through
bootstrapping to simulate error. While the usual data-driven model with
Sigmoidal curves use 12 free parameters, our mechanistic model only has two
free parameters, allowing it to be open to scrutiny rather than forcing
agreement with data. Even so, the simplest model in our framework, derived
here, shows close agreement with the bootstrapped curves, and reproduces well
established relations, such as Haber's rule.

What are the challenges of implementing runtime enforcement strategies in software applications?,38cdcdcd,"Title: Increasing the Reusability of Enforcers with Lifecycle Events

        Abstract:   Runtime enforcement can be effectively used to improve the reliability of
software applications. However, it often requires the definition of ad hoc
policies and enforcement strategies, which might be expensive to identify and
implement. This paper discusses how to exploit lifecycle events to obtain
useful enforcement strategies that can be easily reused across applications,
thus reducing the cost of adoption of the runtime enforcement technology. The
paper finally sketches how this idea can be used to define libraries that can
automatically overcome problems related to applications misusing them.
","After reviewing the papers provided, I found that the challenges of implementing runtime enforcement strategies in software applications are not explicitly stated in any of the abstracts. However, I can provide some insights and relevant information from the papers.

From the paper ""Increasing the Reusability of Enforcers with Lifecycle Events"", it seems that one of the challenges is the need to define ad hoc policies and enforcement strategies, which can be expensive to identify and implement.

From the paper ""Dynamic Security Analysis of Power Systems by a Sampling-Based Algorithm"", it seems that one of the challenges is the complexity of power systems, which can make it challenging to conduct dynamic security analysis. The paper discusses the use of a sampling-based algorithm to search for feasible execution connecting an initial state of the post-fault system and a target set in the desired operation mode.

Unfortunately, I did not find any specific paper that discusses the challenges of implementing runtime enforcement strategies in software applications in-depth. However, I can suggest that you may want to explore more papers on this topic to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and potential solutions.

In summary, while I did not find any specific paper that explicitly discusses the challenges of implementing runtime enforcement strategies in software applications, I can provide some general insights and relevant information from the papers provided.

How can artificial neural networks be used to improve demand forecasting for weather-sensitive products?,40c5cbdb,"Title: Utilizing artificial neural networks to predict demand for weather-sensitive products at retail stores

        Abstract:   One key requirement for effective supply chain management is the quality of
its inventory management. Various inventory management methods are typically
employed for different types of products based on their demand patterns,
product attributes, and supply network. In this paper, our goal is to develop
robust demand prediction methods for weather sensitive products at retail
stores. We employ historical datasets from Walmart, whose customers and markets
are often exposed to extreme weather events which can have a huge impact on
sales regarding the affected stores and products. We want to accurately predict
the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products around the time of
major weather events at 45 of Walmart retails locations in the U.S.
Intuitively, we may expect an uptick in the sales of umbrellas before a big
thunderstorm, but it is difficult for replenishment managers to predict the
level of inventory needed to avoid being out-of-stock or overstock during and
after that storm. While they rely on a variety of vendor tools to predict sales
around extreme weather events, they mostly employ a time-consuming process that
lacks a systematic measure of effectiveness. We employ all the methods critical
to any analytics project and start with data exploration. Critical features are
extracted from the raw historical dataset for demand forecasting accuracy and
robustness. In particular, we employ Artificial Neural Network for forecasting
demand for each product sold around the time of major weather events. Finally,
we evaluate our model to evaluate their accuracy and robustness.

Title: ClusterNet: Detecting Small Objects in Large Scenes by Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Information

Abstract: Object detection in wide area motion imagery (WAMI) has drawn the attention of the computer vision research community for a number of years. WAMI proposes a number of unique challenges including extremely small object sizes, both sparse and densely-packed objects, and extremely large search spaces (large video frames). Nearly all state-of-the-art methods in WAMI object detection report that appearance-based classifiers fail in this challenging data and instead rely almost entirely on motion information in the form of background subtraction or frame-differencing. In this work, we experimentally verify the failure of appearance-based classifiers in WAMI, such as Faster R-CNN and a heatmap-based fully convolutional neural network (CNN), and propose a novel two-stage spatio-temporal CNN which effectively and efficiently combines both appearance and motion information to significantly surpass the state-of-the-art in WAMI object detection. To reduce the large search space, the first stage (ClusterNet) takes in a set of extremely large video frames, combines the motion and appearance information within the convolutional architecture, and proposes regions of objects of interest (ROOBI). These ROOBI can contain from one to clusters of several hundred objects due to the large video frame size and varying object density in WAMI. The second stage (FoveaNet) then estimates the centroid location of all objects in that given ROOBI simultaneously via heatmap estimation. The proposed method exceeds state-of-the-art results on the WPAFB 2009 dataset by 5-16% for moving objects and nearly 50% for stopped objects, as well as being the first proposed method in wide area motion imagery to detect completely stationary objects.",0.18074754

What is the range of odds against the  Lambda CDM model based on analysis of the distance ladder and Planck XIII (2016) CMB data?,ed3bbe2a,"Title: Clarifying the Hubble constant tension with a Bayesian hierarchical model of the local distance ladder

        Abstract:   Estimates of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, from the distance ladder and the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) differ at the $\sim$3-$\sigma$ level,
indicating a potential issue with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Interpreting this tension correctly requires a model comparison calculation
depending on not only the traditional `$n$-$\sigma$' mismatch but also the
tails of the likelihoods. Determining the form of the tails of the local $H_0$
likelihood is impossible with the standard Gaussian least-squares
approximation, as it requires using non-Gaussian distributions to faithfully
represent anchor likelihoods and model outliers in the Cepheid and supernova
(SN) populations, and simultaneous fitting of the full distance-ladder dataset
to correctly propagate uncertainties. We have developed a Bayesian hierarchical
model that describes the full distance ladder, from nearby geometric anchors
through Cepheids to Hubble-Flow SNe. This model does not rely on any
distributions being Gaussian, allowing outliers to be modeled and obviating the
need for arbitrary data cuts. Sampling from the $\sim$3000-parameter joint
posterior using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we find $H_0$ = (72.72 $\pm$ 1.67)
${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ when applied to the outlier-cleaned Riess et al.
(2016) data, and ($73.15 \pm 1.78$) ${\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ with SN
outliers reintroduced. Our high-fidelity sampling of the low-$H_0$ tail of the
distance-ladder likelihood allows us to apply Bayesian model comparison to
assess the evidence for deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. We set up this comparison
to yield a lower limit on the odds of the underlying model being $\Lambda$CDM
given the distance-ladder and Planck XIII (2016) CMB data. The odds against
$\Lambda$CDM are at worst 10:1 or 7:1, depending on whether the SNe outliers
are cut or modeled, or 60:1 if an approximation to the Planck Int. XLVI (2016)

What is the relationship between stellar activity and infrared observations of exoplanets with JWST?,dbc9f6d4,"Title: Forecasting the Impact of Stellar Activity on Transiting Exoplanet Spectra

How can distributed computing techniques be used to improve the efficiency of block-based matrix approximation?,1476108a,"Title: Block CUR: Decomposing Matrices using Groups of Columns

decomposition. Unfortunately, in many real-world environments, the ability to
sample specific individual rows or columns of the matrix is limited by either
system constraints or cost. In this paper, we consider matrix approximation by
sampling predefined \emph{blocks} of columns (or rows) from the matrix. We
present an algorithm for sampling useful column blocks and provide novel
guarantees for the quality of the approximation. This algorithm has application

demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for computing the
Block CUR decomposition of large matrices in a distributed setting with
multiple nodes in a compute cluster, where such blocks correspond to columns
(or rows) of the matrix stored on the same node, which can be retrieved with
much less overhead than retrieving individual columns stored across different
nodes. In the biometric setting, the rows correspond to different users and
columns correspond to users' biometric reaction to external stimuli, {\em
e.g.,}~watching video content, at a particular time instant. There is
significant cost in acquiring each user's reaction to lengthy content so we
sample a few important scenes to approximate the biometric response. An
individual time sample in this use case cannot be queried in isolation due to
the lack of context that caused that biometric reaction. Instead, collections
of time segments ({\em i.e.,} blocks) must be presented to the user. The
practical application of these algorithms is shown via experimental results
using real-world user biometric data from a content testing environment.

What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency in compressive sensing (CS) algorithms?,73dca852,"Title: High SNR Consistent Compressive Sensing

        Abstract:   High signal to noise ratio (SNR) consistency of model selection criteria in
linear regression models has attracted a lot of attention recently. However,
most of the existing literature on high SNR consistency deals with model order
selection. Further, the limited literature available on the high SNR
consistency of subset selection procedures (SSPs) is applicable to linear
regression with full rank measurement matrices only. Hence, the performance of
SSPs used in underdetermined linear models (a.k.a compressive sensing (CS)
algorithms) at high SNR is largely unknown. This paper fills this gap by
deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for the high SNR consistency of
popular CS algorithms like $l_0$-minimization, basis pursuit de-noising or
LASSO, orthogonal matching pursuit and Dantzig selector. Necessary conditions

Title: Robust Gesture-Based Communication for Underwater Human-Robot Interaction in the context of Search and Rescue Diver Missions

Abstract: We propose a robust gesture-based communication pipeline for divers to instruct an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) to assist them in performing high-risk tasks and helping in case of emergency. A gesture communication language (CADDIAN) is developed, based on consolidated and standardized diver gestures, including an alphabet, syntax and semantics, ensuring a logical consistency. A hierarchical classification approach is introduced for hand gesture recognition based on stereo imagery and multi-descriptor aggregation to specifically cope with underwater image artifacts, e.g. light backscatter or color attenuation.

It appears that this paper addresses the challenges posed by underwater image quality, such as backscatter and color distortion, through the use of stereo imagery and multi-descriptor aggregation for hand gesture recognition. The hierarchical classification approach is specifically designed to cope with underwater image artifacts, ensuring more accurate recognition of gestures underwater.",0.93042237

"How do fragility curves, which represent the probability of failure of a structure under earthquake ground motion, change when using non-parametric methods compared to the classical lognormal approach? ",b39b82c7,"Title: Seismic fragility curves for structures using non-parametric representations

        Abstract:   Fragility curves are commonly used in civil engineering to assess the
vulnerability of structures to earthquakes. The probability of failure
associated with a prescribed criterion (e.g. the maximal inter-storey drift of
a building exceeding a certain threshold) is represented as a function of the
intensity of the earthquake ground motion (e.g. peak ground acceleration or
spectral acceleration). The classical approach relies on assuming a lognormal
shape of the fragility curves; it is thus parametric. In this paper, we
introduce two non-parametric approaches to establish the fragility curves
without employing the above assumption, namely binned Monte Carlo simulation
and kernel density estimation. As an illustration, we compute the fragility
curves for a three-storey steel frame using a large number of synthetic ground
motions. The curves obtained with the non-parametric approaches are compared
with respective curves based on the lognormal assumption. A similar comparison
is presented for a case when a limited number of recorded ground motions is
available. It is found that the accuracy of the lognormal curves depends on the
ground motion intensity measure, the failure criterion and most importantly, on
the employed method for estimating the parameters of the lognormal shape.
","What a great question!

According to the paper ""Seismic fragility curves for structures using non-parametric representations"", the fragility curves, which represent the probability of failure of a structure under earthquake ground motion, change significantly when using non-parametric methods compared to the classical lognormal approach.

Here's the relevant information:

* The paper introduces two non-parametric approaches to establish fragility curves: binned Monte Carlo simulation and kernel density estimation.
* These approaches are compared to the classical lognormal assumption-based fragility curves.
* The results show that the accuracy of the lognormal curves depends on the ground motion intensity measure, the failure criterion, and most importantly, on the employed method for estimating the parameters of the lognormal shape.

So, in summary, the non-parametric methods can provide more accurate and robust fragility curves compared to the classical lognormal approach, which relies on assumptions about the shape of the fragility curve.

How does the density of inter-links between layers impact global synchronization in duplex networks? ,47a6008e,"Title: Phase Synchronization on Spacially Embeded Duplex Networks with Total Cost Constraint

        Abstract:   Synchronization on multiplex networks have attracted increasing attention in
the past few years. We investigate collective behaviors of Kuramoto oscillators
on single layer and duplex spacial networks with total cost restriction, which
was introduced by Li et. al [Li G., Reis S. D., Moreira A. A., Havlin S.,
Stanley H. E. and Jr A. J., {\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} 104, 018701 (2010)] and
termed as the Li network afterwards. In the Li network model, with the increase
of its spacial exponent, the network's structure will vary from the random type
to the small-world one, and finally to the regular lattice.We first explore how
the spacial exponent influences the synchronizability of Kuramoto oscillators
on single layer Li networks and find that the closer the Li network is to a
regular lattice, the more difficult for it to evolve into synchronization. Then
we investigate synchronizability of duplex Li networks and find that the
existence of inter-layer interaction can greatly enhance inter-layer and global
synchronizability. When the inter-layer coupling strength is larger than a
certain critical value, whatever the intra-layer coupling strength is, the
inter-layer synchronization will always occur. Furthermore, on single layer Li
networks, nodes with larger degrees more easily reach global synchronization,
while on duplex Li networks, this phenomenon becomes much less obvious.
Finally, we study the impact of inter-link density on global synchronization
and obtain that sparse inter-links can lead to the emergence of global
synchronization for duplex Li networks just as dense inter-links do. In a word,
inter-layer interaction plays a vital role in determining synchronizability for
duplex spacial networks with total cost constraint.

methods, along with the strong difference found between the intra- and the
interchain DMRG short spin-spin correlations; for sufficiently large values of

fluctuations and the dimensional crossover effects gives rise to the
one-dimensionalization phenomenon in this frustrated spin-$1$ Hamiltonian.

statistical tests show that a power law is not a good fit, so the networks are
not scale-free. These results for clusters are compared with the corresponding

        Abstract:   We characterize the response of the quiet time (no substorms or storms)
large-scale ionospheric transient equivalent currents to north-south and
south-north IMF turnings by using a dynamical network of ground-based
magnetometers. Canonical correlation between all pairs of SuperMAG magnetometer
stations in the Northern Hemisphere (magnetic latitude (MLAT) 50-82$^{\circ}$)
is used to establish the extent of near-simultaneous magnetic response between
regions of magnetic local time-MLAT. Parameters and maps that describe
spatial-temporal correlation are used to characterize the system and its
response to the turnings aggregated over several hundred events. We find that
regions that experience large increases in correlation post turning coincide
with typical locations of a two-cell convection system and are influenced by
the interplanetary magnetic field $\mathit{B}_{y}$. The time between the
turnings reaching the magnetopause and a network response is found to be

variable colour within a range that is broadly consistent with local small
bodies such as the P/D type asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and dynamically excited
Kuiper Belt Objects. 1I/'Oumuamua appears unusually elongated in shape, with an
axial ratio exceeding 5:1. Rotation period estimates are inconsistent and
varied, with reported values between 6.9 and 8.3 hours. Here we analyse all
available optical photometry reported to date. No single rotation period can
explain the exhibited brightness variations. Rather, 1I/'Oumuamua appears to be
in an excited rotational state undergoing Non-Principal Axis (NPA) rotation, or
tumbling. A satisfactory solution has apparent lightcurve frequencies of 0.135

available data are insufficient to uniquely constrain the true frequencies and
shape. Assuming a body that responds to NPA rotation in a similar manner to
Solar System asteroids and comets, the timescale to damp 1I/'Oumuamua's

How does the tensor of inertia change over time in a viscoelastic shell?,b5fb0ab9,"Title: Rotation of a synchronous viscoelastic shell

        Abstract:   Several natural satellites of the giant planets have shown evidence of a
global internal ocean, coated by a thin, icy crust. This crust is probably
viscoelastic, which would alter its rotational response. This response would
translate into several rotational quantities, i.e. the obliquity, and the
librations at different frequencies, for which the crustal elasticity reacts
differently. This study aims at modelling the global response of the
viscoelastic crust. For that, I derive the time-dependency of the tensor of
inertia, which I combine with the time evolution of the rotational quantities,
thanks to an iterative algorithm. This algorithm combines numerical simulations
of the rotation with a digital filtering of the resulting tensor of inertia.
The algorithm works very well in the elastic case, provided the problem is not

Under what conditions can the SINR be considered asymptotically deterministic in large but finite antenna MIMO systems? ,294bbcc4,"Title: Performance Scaling Law for Multi-Cell Multi-User Massive MIMO

channel spatial correlation are all considered. First, a sum- rate lower bound
is derived by exploiting the asymptotically deterministic property of the
received signal power, while keeping the random nature of other components in
the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) intact. Via a general
scaling model on important network parameters, including the number of users,
the channel training energy and the data transmission power, with respect to
the number of base station antennas, the asymptotic scaling law of the
effective SINR is obtained, which reveals quantitatively the tradeoff of the

contamination elimination (PCE) are considered in the analytical framework. In
addition, the applicability of the derived asymptotic scaling law in practical
systems with large but finite antenna numbers are discussed. Finally,
sufficient conditions on the parameter scalings for the SINR to be
asymptotically deterministic in the sense of mean square convergence are

to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative
features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate

demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and
advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second
network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling
applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids
with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and

different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG microstate).
They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an optimally predictive

Searching for the Transit of the Earth--mass exoplanet Proxima~Centauri~b in Antarctica: Preliminary Result

Abstract: Proxima Centauri is known as the closest star from the Sun. Recently, radial velocity observations revealed the existence of an Earth-mass planet around it. With an orbital period of ~11 days, the surface of Proxima Centauri b is temperate and might be habitable. We took a photometric monitoring campaign to search for its transit, using the Bright Star Survey Telescope at the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica. A transit-like signal appearing on 2016 September 8th, is identified tentatively. Its midtime, $T_{C}=2,457,640.1990\pm0.0017$ HJD, is consistent with the predicted ephemeris based on RV orbit in a 1$\sigma$ confidence interval. Time-correlated noise is pronounced in the light curve of Proxima Centauri, affecting detection of transits. We develop a technique, in a Gaussian process framework, to gauge the statistical significance of potential transit detection. The tentative transit signal reported here, has a confidence level of $2.5\sigma$. Further detection of its periodic signals is necessary to confirm the planetary transit of Proxima Centauri b. We plan to monitor Proxima Centauri in next Polar night at Dome A in Antarctica, taking the advantage of continuous darkness. \citet{Kipping17} reported two tentative transit-like signals of Proxima Centauri b, observed by the Microvariability and Oscillation of Stars space Telescope in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The midtransit time of our detection is 138 minutes later than that predicted by their transit ephemeris. If all the signals are real transits, the misalignment of the epochs plausibly suggests transit timing variations of Proxima Centauri b induced by an outer planet in this system.

What dataset was used to train and validate a deep learning model for lung nodule malignancy classification? ,56eee4d2,"Title: Highly accurate model for prediction of lung nodule malignancy with CT scans

        Abstract:   Computed tomography (CT) examinations are commonly used to predict lung
nodule malignancy in patients, which are shown to improve noninvasive early
diagnosis of lung cancer. It remains challenging for computational approaches
to achieve performance comparable to experienced radiologists. Here we present
NoduleX, a systematic approach to predict lung nodule malignancy from CT data,

validation, we analyze >1000 lung nodules in images from the LIDC/IDRI cohort.
All nodules were identified and classified by four experienced thoracic
radiologists who participated in the LIDC project. NoduleX achieves high
accuracy for nodule malignancy classification, with an AUC of ~0.99. This is

What happens to the maximizer sets of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue when the obstacle is convex?,beb4e8c5,"Title: On maximizing the fundamental frequency of the complement of an obstacle

        Abstract:   Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded domain satisfying a
Hayman-type asymmetry condition, and let $ D $ be an arbitrary bounded domain
referred to as ""obstacle"". We are interested in the behaviour of the first
Dirichlet eigenvalue $ \lambda_1(\Omega \setminus (x+D)) $. First, we prove an

of the set $ x+D $ to the set of maximum points $ x_0 $ of the first Dirichlet
ground state $ \phi_{\lambda_1} > 0 $ of $ \Omega $. In short, a direct
corollary is that if \begin{equation} \mu_\Omega := \max_{x}\lambda_1(\Omega

$, then all maximizer sets $ x+D $ of $ \mu_\Omega $ are close to each maximum
point $ x_0 $ of $ \phi_{\lambda_1} $.
Second, we discuss the distribution of $ \phi_{\lambda_1(\Omega)} $ and the
possibility to inscribe wavelength balls at a given point in $ \Omega $.
Finally, we specify our observations to convex obstacles $ D $ and show that
if $ \mu_\Omega $ is sufficiently large with respect to $ \lambda_1(\Omega) $,

Why does Klinkenberg's correction factor decrease as the Knudsen number increases?,1affc023,"Title: On the apparent permeability of porous media in rarefied gas flows

        Abstract:   The apparent gas permeability of the porous medium is an important parameter
in the prediction of unconventional gas production, which was first
investigated systematically by Klinkenberg in 1941 and found to increase with
the reciprocal mean gas pressure (or equivalently, the Knudsen number).
Although the underlying rarefaction effects are well-known, the reason that the
correction factor in Klinkenberg's famous equation decreases when the Knudsen
number increases has not been fully understood. Most of the studies idealize
the porous medium as a bundle of straight cylindrical tubes, however, according
to the gas kinetic theory, this only results in an increase of the correction
factor with the Knudsen number, which clearly contradicts Klinkenberg's
experimental observations. Here, by solving the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook equation
in simplified (but not simple) porous media, we identify, for the first time,
two key factors that can explain Klinkenberg's experimental results: the
tortuous flow path and the non-unitary tangential momentum accommodation
coefficient for the gas-surface interaction. Moreover, we find that
Klinkenberg's results can only be observed when the ratio between the apparent
and intrinsic permeabilities is $\lesssim30$; at large ratios (or Knudsen
numbers) the correction factor increases with the Knudsen number. Our numerical
results could also serve as benchmarking cases to assess the accuracy of
macroscopic models and/or numerical schemes for the modeling/simulation of
rarefied gas flows in complex geometries over a wide range of gas rarefaction.

What are some examples of image datasets and GAN architectures that benefit from the proposed training method?,253ca9b4,"Title: GANs Trained by a Two Time-Scale Update Rule Converge to a Local Nash Equilibrium

        Abstract:   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at creating realistic images
with complex models for which maximum likelihood is infeasible. However, the
convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two
time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient
descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions. TTUR has an individual learning rate
for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic
approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a
stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular
Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy
ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For
the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the
""Fréchet Inception Distance"" (FID) which captures the similarity of generated
images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, TTUR
improves learning for DCGANs and Improved Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP)

"What are the exchange splittings between excited states in donor pairs and three-donor arrays in silicon, and how do they compare to ground state splittings? ",1d0bb4aa,"Title: Excited states of defect lines in silicon: A first-principles study based on hydrogen cluster analogues

        Abstract:   Excited states of a single donor in bulk silicon have previously been studied
extensively based on effective mass theory. However, a proper theoretical
description of the excited states of a donor cluster is still scarce. Here we
study the excitations of lines of defects within a single-valley spherical band
approximation, thus mapping the problem to a scaled hydrogen atom array. A
series of detailed full configuration-interaction and time-dependent hybrid
density-functional theory calculations have been performed to understand linear
clusters of up to 10 donors. Our studies illustrate the generic features of
their excited states, addressing the competition between formation of
inter-donor ionic states and intra-donor atomic excited states. At short
inter-donor distances, excited states of donor molecules are dominant, at
intermediate distances ionic states play an important role, and at long
distances the intra-donor excitations are predominant as expected. The
calculations presented here emphasise the importance of correlations between
donor electrons, and are thus complementary to other recent approaches that
include effective mass anisotropy and multi-valley effects. The exchange
splittings between relevant excited states have also been estimated for a donor
pair and for a three-donor arrays; the splittings are much larger than those in
the ground state in the range of donor separations between 10 and 20 nm. This
establishes a solid theoretical basis for the use of excited-state exchange
interactions for controllable quantum gate operations in silicon.

How does a task formalization contribute to improving communication efficiency in ADER-DG?,f0297d01,"Title: Stop talking to me -- a communication-avoiding ADER-DG realisation

        Abstract:   We present a communication- and data-sensitive formulation of ADER-DG for
hyperbolic differential equation systems. Sensitive here has multiple flavours:
First, the formulation reduces the persistent memory footprint. This reduces
pressure on the memory subsystem. Second, the formulation realises the
underlying predictor-corrector scheme with single-touch semantics, i.e., each
degree of freedom is read on average only once per time step from the main
memory. This reduces communication through the memory controllers. Third, the
formulation breaks up the tight coupling of the explicit time stepping's
algorithmic steps to mesh traversals. This averages out data access peaks.
Different operations and algorithmic steps are ran on different grid entities.
Finally, the formulation hides distributed memory data transfer behind the
computation aligned with the mesh traversal. This reduces pressure on the
machine interconnects. All techniques applied by our formulation are elaborated
by means of a rigorous task formalism. They break up ADER-DG's tight causal
coupling of compute steps and can be generalised to other predictor-corrector
schemes.

What are some applications of finding lower bounds for the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite matrix?,6fcfed81,"Title: On the optimality and sharpness of Laguerre's lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite matrix

        Abstract:   Lower bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite
matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ play an important role in condition
number estimation and in iterative methods for singular value computation. In
particular, the bounds based on ${\rm Tr}(A^{-1})$ and ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})$
attract attention recently because they can be computed in $O(m)$ work when $A$
is tridiagonal. In this paper, we focus on these bounds and investigate their
properties in detail. First, we consider the problem of finding the optimal
bound that can be computed solely from ${\rm Tr}(A^{-1})$ and ${\rm
Tr}(A^{-2})$ and show that so called Laguerre's lower bound is the optimal one
in terms of sharpness. Next, we study the gap between the Laguerre bound and
the smallest eigenvalue. We characterize the situation in which the gap becomes
largest in terms of the eigenvalue distribution of $A$ and show that the gap
becomes smallest when ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})/\{{\rm Tr}(A^{-1})\}^2$ approaches 1 or
$\frac{1}{m}$. These results will be useful, for example, in designing
efficient shift strategies for singular value computation algorithms.

the intermediate SNR regime forming coded chunks in the signal domain results
in power loss, and will deteriorate throughput of the second scheme. The main

What type of radioactive decay powers a macronova?,0205243c,"Title: Analytic heating rate of neutron star merger ejecta derived from Fermi's theory of beta decay

        Abstract:   Macronovae (kilonovae) that arise in binary neutron star mergers are powered
by radioactive beta decay of hundreds of $r$-process nuclides. We derive, using
Fermi's theory of beta decay, an analytic estimate of the nuclear heating rate.
We show that the heating rate evolves as a power law ranging between $t^{-6/5}$
to $t^{-4/3}$. The overall magnitude of the heating rate is determined by the
mean values of nuclear quantities, e.g., the nuclear matrix elements of beta
decay. These values are specified by using nuclear experimental data. We
discuss the role of higher order beta transitions and the robustness of the
power law. The robust and simple form of the heating rate suggests that
observations of the late-time bolometric light curve $\propto t^{-\frac{4}{3}}$
would be a direct evidence of a $r$-process driven macronova. Such observations
could also enable us to estimate the total amount of $r$-process nuclei

How does the proposed method for multiphase flows address backflow instability?,3c553cbc,"Title: Multiphase Flows of N Immiscible Incompressible Fluids: An Outflow/Open Boundary Condition and Algorithm

        Abstract:   We present a set of effective outflow/open boundary conditions and an
associated algorithm for simulating the dynamics of multiphase flows consisting
of $N$ ($N\geqslant 2$) immiscible incompressible fluids in domains involving
outflows or open boundaries. These boundary conditions are devised based on the
properties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability
property ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the
energy balance will not cause the total energy of the N-phase system to
increase over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary conditions are very
effective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems. The
reduction consistency property ensures that if some fluid components are absent
from the N-phase system then these N-phase boundary conditions will reduce to
those corresponding boundary conditions for the equivalent smaller system. Our
numerical algorithm for the proposed boundary conditions together with the
N-phase governing equations involves only the solution of a set of de-coupled
individual Helmholtz-type equations within each time step, and the resultant
linear algebraic systems after discretization involve only constant and
time-independent coefficient matrices which can be pre-computed. Therefore, the
algorithm is computationally very efficient and attractive. We present
extensive numerical experiments for flow problems involving multiple fluid
components and inflow/outflow boundaries to test the proposed method. In
particular, we compare in detail the simulation results of a three-phase
capillary wave problem with Prosperetti's exact physical solution and
demonstrate that the method developed herein produces physically accurate
results.

$\Theta(n^{3/2})$ homotopy moves in the worst case. Our algorithm improves the
best previous upper bound $O(n^2)$, which is already implicit in the classical
work of Steinitz; the matching lower bound follows from the construction of
closed curves with large defect, a topological invariant of generic closed
curves introduced by Aicardi and Arnold. Our lower bound also implies that
$\Omega(n^{3/2})$ facial electrical transformations are required to reduce any
plane graph with treewidth $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ to a single vertex, matching
known upper bounds for rectangular and cylindrical grid graphs. More generally,
we prove that transforming one immersion of $k$ circles with at most $n$
self-crossings into another requires $\Theta(n^{3/2} + nk + k^2)$ homotopy
moves in the worst case. Finally, we prove that transforming one
noncontractible closed curve to another on any orientable surface requires
$\Omega(n^2)$ homotopy moves in the worst case; this lower bound is tight if
the curve is homotopic to a simple closed curve.

        Abstract:   The purpose of this paper is to formulate and study a common refinement of a

$p$-adic period ring and $p$-adic Hodge theory. We construct period-ring-valued
functions under a generalization of Yoshida's conjecture on the transcendental
parts of CM-periods. Then we conjecture a reciprocity law on their special

implies a part of Stark's conjecture when the base field is an arbitrary real
field and the splitting place is its real place. It also implies a refinement
of the Gross-Stark conjecture under a certain assumption. When the base field

Are there specific step-size tuning algorithms for linear stochastic approximation that take into account the distribution of the data?,1d79ba08,"Title: Linear Stochastic Approximation: Constant Step-Size and Iterate Averaging

learning (RL), where the aim is to compute an appropriate $\theta_{*} \in

updates per iteration. In this paper, we are motivated by the problem (in RL)
of policy evaluation from experience replay using the \emph{temporal
difference} (TD) class of learning algorithms that are also LSAs. For LSAs with
a constant step-size, and PR averaging, we provide bounds for the mean squared
error (MSE) after $t$ iterations. We assume that data is \iid with finite
variance (underlying distribution being $P$) and that the expected dynamics is
Hurwitz. For a given LSA with PR averaging, and data distribution $P$
satisfying the said assumptions, we show that there exists a range of constant
step-sizes such that its MSE decays as $O(\frac{1}{t})$.
We examine the conditions under which a constant step-size can be chosen
uniformly for a class of data distributions $\mathcal{P}$, and show that not
all data distributions `admit' such a uniform constant step-size. We also
suggest a heuristic step-size tuning algorithm to choose a constant step-size

convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two
time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient

Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy
ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For

What is an alternative to the rich club in complex networks that may be more important for global integration?,d5f3b750,"Title: The Diverse Club: The Integrative Core of Complex Networks

between neurons as edges. In many networks, some nodes have a
disproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges
between each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different
networks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network
integration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity
structure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a
myriad of different biological and man-made networks, we discover the diverse

The diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties
consistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly
interconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global
integration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that
produces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating
that these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures.

 In what way do edge modes manifest in a 4D topological system?,c01e95e9,"Title: Photonic topological pumping through the edges of a dynamical four-dimensional quantum Hall system

        Abstract:   When a two-dimensional electron gas is exposed to a perpendicular magnetic
field and an in-plane electric field, its conductance becomes quantized in the
transverse in-plane direction: this is known as the quantum Hall (QH) effect.
This effect is a result of the nontrivial topology of the system's electronic
band structure, where an integer topological invariant known as the first Chern
number leads to the quantization of the Hall conductance. Interestingly, it was
shown that the QH effect can be generalized mathematically to four spatial
dimensions (4D), but this effect has never been realized for the obvious reason
that experimental systems are bound to three spatial dimensions. In this work,
we harness the high tunability and control offered by photonic waveguide arrays
to experimentally realize a dynamically-generated 4D QH system using a 2D array
of coupled optical waveguides. The inter-waveguide separation is constructed
such that the propagation of light along the device samples over
higher-dimensional momenta in the directions orthogonal to the two physical
dimensions, thus realizing a 2D topological pump. As a result, the device's
band structure is associated with 4D topological invariants known as second
Chern numbers which support a quantized bulk Hall response with a 4D symmetry.
In a finite-sized system, the 4D topological bulk response is carried by
localized edges modes that cross the sample as a function of of the modulated
auxiliary momenta. We directly observe this crossing through photon pumping
from edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner of our system. These are equivalent to
the pumping of charge across a 4D system from one 3D hypersurface to the
opposite one and from one 2D hyperedge to another, and serve as first

How do density discontinuities and rigid body rotation potentially impact numerical simulations of large-scale impacts?,a9361912,"Title: SPH calculations of Mars-scale collisions: the role of the Equation of State, material rheologies, and numerical effects

        Abstract:   We model large-scale ($\approx$2000km) impacts on a Mars-like planet using a

using different Equations of State on the post-impact material and temperature
distributions are investigated. The properties of the ejected material in terms
of escaping and disc mass are analysed as well. We also study potential
numerical effects in the context of density discontinuities and rigid body

substantial for the post-impact distribution of the temperature and the
impactor material, while the influence of the Equation of State is more subtle

        Abstract:   Lower bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite

number estimation and in iterative methods for singular value computation. In
particular, the bounds based on ${\rm Tr}(A^{-1})$ and ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})$
attract attention recently because they can be computed in $O(m)$ work when $A$
is tridiagonal. In this paper, we focus on these bounds and investigate their
properties in detail. First, we consider the problem of finding the optimal
bound that can be computed solely from ${\rm Tr}(A^{-1})$ and ${\rm
Tr}(A^{-2})$ and show that so called Laguerre's lower bound is the optimal one
in terms of sharpness. Next, we study the gap between the Laguerre bound and
the smallest eigenvalue. We characterize the situation in which the gap becomes
largest in terms of the eigenvalue distribution of $A$ and show that the gap
becomes smallest when ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})/\{{\rm Tr}(A^{-1})\}^2$ approaches 1 or
$\frac{1}{m}$. These results will be useful, for example, in designing
efficient shift strategies for singular value computation algorithms.

How does a new method for estimating vaccination uptake compare to methods using clinical data?,7b1d3b2e,"Title: Time-Series Adaptive Estimation of Vaccination Uptake Using Web Search Queries

        Abstract:   Estimating vaccination uptake is an integral part of ensuring public health.
It was recently shown that vaccination uptake can be estimated automatically
from web data, instead of slowly collected clinical records or population
surveys. All prior work in this area assumes that features of vaccination
uptake collected from the web are temporally regular. We present the first ever
method to remove this assumption from vaccination uptake estimation: our method
dynamically adapts to temporal fluctuations in time series web data used to
estimate vaccination uptake. We show our method to outperform the state of the
art compared to competitive baselines that use not only web data but also
curated clinical data. This performance improvement is more pronounced for
vaccines whose uptake has been irregular due to negative media attention (HPV-1

What happens to star clusters in dwarf galaxies that have preserved their original dark matter cusp?,aba7d3ed,"Title: Deadly dark matter cusps vs faint and extended star clusters: Eridanus II and Andromeda XXV

        Abstract:   The recent detection of two faint and extended star clusters in the central
regions of two Local Group dwarf galaxies, Eridanus II and Andromeda XXV,
raises the question of whether clusters with such low densities can survive the
tidal field of cold dark matter haloes with central density cusps. Using both
analytic arguments and a suite of collisionless N-body simulations, I show that
these clusters are extremely fragile and quickly disrupted in the presence of
central cusps $\rho\sim r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha\gtrsim 0.2$. Furthermore, the
scenario in which the clusters where originally more massive and sank to the
center of the halo requires extreme fine tuning and does not naturally
reproduce the observed systems. In turn, these clusters are long lived in cored
haloes, whose central regions are safe shelters for $\alpha\lesssim 0.2$. The
only viable scenario for hosts that have preserved their primoridal cusp to the
present time is that the clusters formed at rest at the bottom of the
potential, which is easily tested by measurement of the clusters proper
velocity within the host. This offers means to readily probe the central
density profile of two dwarf galaxies as faint as $L_V\sim5\times 10^5 L_\odot$
and $L_V\sim6\times10^4 L_\odot$, in which stellar feedback is unlikely to be
effective.

Title: Deadly dark matter cusps vs faint and extended star clusters: Eridanus II and Andromeda XXV

Abstract:

Using both analytic arguments and a suite of collisionless N-body simulations, I show that these clusters are extremely fragile and quickly disrupted in the presence of central cusps ρ∼r^(−α) with α≳0.2. Furthermore, the scenario in which the clusters were originally more massive and sank to the center of the halo requires extreme fine tuning and does not naturally reproduce the observed systems. In turn, these clusters are long-lived in cored haloes, whose central regions are safe shelters for α≲0.2. The only viable scenario for hosts that have preserved their primordial cusp to the present time is that the clusters formed at rest at the bottom of the potential, which is easily tested by measurement of the cluster’s proper velocity within the host.

Based on this abstract, it appears that if a dwarf galaxy has preserved its original dark matter cusp, the star clusters within it would be long-lived due to the cored halo, and the cluster would have to have formed at rest at the bottom of the potential in order to survive the central cusp.

controller to improve trajectory tracking of a system subject to unknown and

higher-level model predictive controller then uses this reference model to
calculate the optimal reference input based on a cost function, while taking
into account input and state constraints. We focus on the experimental

        Abstract:   Development of a mesoscale neural circuitry map of the common marmoset is an
essential task due to the ideal characteristics of the marmoset as a model
organism for neuroscience research. To facilitate this development there is a
need for new computational tools to cross-register multi-modal data sets
containing MRI volumes as well as multiple histological series, and to register
the combined data set to a common reference atlas. We present a fully automatic
pipeline for same-subject-MRI guided reconstruction of image volumes from a
series of histological sections of different modalities, followed by
diffeomorphic mapping to a reference atlas. We show registration results for
Nissl, myelin, CTB, and fluorescent tracer images using a same-subject ex-vivo
MRI as our reference and show that our method achieves accurate registration
and eliminates artifactual warping that may be result from the absence of a
reference MRI data set. Examination of the determinant of the local metric
tensor of the diffeomorphic mapping between each subject's ex-vivo MRI and
resultant Nissl reconstruction allows an unprecedented local quantification of
geometrical distortions resulting from the histological processing, showing a
slight shrinkage, a median linear scale change of ~-1% in going from the

What is the evolutionary outcome of varying the parameters in an N-person Hawk-Dove game?,125b89e9,"Title: Evolutionary dynamics of N-person Hawk-Dove games

        Abstract:   In the animal world, the competition between individuals belonging to
different species for a resource often requires the cooperation of several
individuals in groups. This paper proposes a generalization of the Hawk-Dove
Game for an arbitrary number of agents: the N-person Hawk-Dove Game. In this
model, doves exemplify the cooperative behavior without intraspecies conflict,
while hawks represent the aggressive behavior. In the absence of hawks, doves
share the resource equally and avoid conflict, but having hawks around lead to
doves escaping without fighting. Conversely, hawks fight for the resource at
the cost of getting injured. Nevertheless, if doves are present in sufficient
number to expel the hawks, they can aggregate to protect the resource, and thus
avoid being plundered by hawks. We derive and numerically solve an exact
equation for the evolution of the system in both finite and infinite well-mixed

Is it possible to identify the source of a digitally stabilized video using a non-stabilized reference?,9177be94,"Title: A Hybrid Approach to Video Source Identification

        Abstract:   Multimedia Forensics allows to determine whether videos or images have been
captured with the same device, and thus, eventually, by the same person.
Currently, the most promising technology to achieve this task, exploits the
unique traces left by the camera sensor into the visual content. Anyway, image
and video source identification are still treated separately from one another.
This approach is limited and anachronistic if we consider that most of the
visual media are today acquired using smartphones, that capture both images and
videos. In this paper we overcome this limitation by exploring a new approach
that allows to synergistically exploit images and videos to study the device
from which they both come. Indeed, we prove it is possible to identify the
source of a digital video by exploiting a reference sensor pattern noise
generated from still images taken by the same device of the query video. The
proposed method provides comparable or even better performance, when compared
to the current video identification strategies, where a reference pattern is
estimated from video frames. We also show how this strategy can be effective
even in case of in-camera digitally stabilized videos, where a non-stabilized
reference is not available, by solving some state-of-the-art limitations. We
explore a possible direct application of this result, that is social media

interactions, which lead to evolution equations involving sparse matrices, and
long-range interactions, which lead to dense matrices. Both of these settings

modest. In most cases the commutator-free variant is superior but especially on

Has a giant planet been observed orbiting a star in the temperature range between A and B types?,ed061da3,"Title: A giant planet undergoing extreme ultraviolet irradiation by its hot massive-star host

        Abstract:   The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet
depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of
extra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that
transit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to
transit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature
of ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is
itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat
differential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,
traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the
temperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the
molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of
ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be
significantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report
observations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbital
period ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host star
is at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the
KELT-9b's day-side temperature to be ~4600K. This is as hot as stars of stellar
type K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus the
primary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likely
atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme
ultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,
leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet
largely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host
star.

        Abstract:   The calculation of caloric properties such as heat capacity, Joule-Thomson

simulation methodology has received scant attention in the literature,
particularly for systems composed of complex molecules whose force fields (FFs)
are characterized by a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular terms
(referred to herein as ""flexible FFs""). The calculation of a thermodynamic
property for a system whose molecules are described by such a FF involves the
calculation of the residual property prior to its addition to the corresponding
ideal-gas (IG) property, the latter of which is separately calculated, either
using thermochemical compilations or nowadays accurate quantum mechanical
calculations. Although the simulation of a volumetric residual property
proceeds by simply replacing the intermolecular FF in the rigid molecule case
by the total (intramolecular plus intermolecular) FF, this is not the case for
a caloric property. We discuss the methodology required in performing such

"According to the paper, what is different about the mechanism for divergence in length scale compared to other theoretical models?",b2d25d3f,"Title: Growing length scale accompanying the vitrification: A perspective based on non-singular density fluctuations

        Abstract:   In glass forming liquids close to the glass transition point, even a very
slight increase in the macroscopic density results in a dramatic slowing down
of the macroscopic relaxation. Concomitantly, the local density itself
fluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local
density variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective,
a model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is
introduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a
certain threshold value, $\rho_{\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle
rearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period
($\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy
cluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict
that with compression (increasing average density $\rho$) at a fixed
temperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the
clusters, $\xi$, diverges as $\xi\sim(\rho_{\rm c}-\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is
the spatial dimensionality. This $\xi$ measures the average persistence length
of the steric constraints in blocking the rearrangement motions and is
determined by the subsystem density. Additionally, with decreasing $T$ at a
fixed $\rho$, the length scale diverges in the same manner as $\xi\sim(T-T_{\rm
c})^{-2/d}$, for which $\rho$ is identical to $\rho_{\rm c}$ at $T=T_{\rm c}$.
The exponent describing the diverging length scale is the same as the one
predicted by some theoretical models and indeed has been observed in some
simulations and experiments. However, the basic mechanism for this divergence
is different; that is, we do not invoke thermodynamic anomalies associated with
the thermodynamic phase transition as the origin of the growing length scale.
We further present arguements for the cooperative properties based on the
clusters.

disproportionately high number of edges. These nodes also have many edges
between each other, and are referred to as the rich club. In many different
networks, the nodes of this club are assumed to support global network
integration. However, another set of nodes potentially exhibits a connectivity
structure that is more advantageous to global network integration. Here, in a

The diverse club exhibits, to a greater extent than the rich club, properties
consistent with an integrative network function--these nodes are more highly
interconnected and their edges are more critical for efficient global
integration. Moreover, we present a generative evolutionary network model that
produces networks with a diverse club but not a rich club, thus demonstrating
that these two clubs potentially evolved via distinct selection pressures.

What is the relationship between the  magnitude of a frequency vector  k and the behavior of the exponential sum?,ba643293,"Title: Exponential Sums and Riesz energies

        Abstract:   We bound an exponential sum that appears in the study of irregularities of
distribution (the low-frequency Fourier energy of the sum of several Dirac
measures) by geometric quantities: a special case is that for all $\left\{ x_1,
\dots, x_N\right\} \subset \mathbb{T}^2$, $X \geq 1$ and a universal $c>0$ $$
\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{ \frac{X^2}{1 + X^4 \|x_i -x_j\|^4}} \lesssim \sum_{k \in
\mathbb{Z}^2 \atop \|k\| \leq X}{ \left| \sum_{n=1}^{N}{ e^{2 \pi i
\left\langle k, x_n \right\rangle}}\right|^2} \lesssim \sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{ X^2
e^{-c X^2\|x_i -x_j\|^2}}.$$ Since this exponential sum is intimately tied to
rather subtle distribution properties of the points, we obtain nonlocal
structural statements for near-minimizers of the Riesz-type energy. In the
regime $X \gtrsim N^{1/2}$ both upper and lower bound match for
maximally-separated point sets satisfying $\|x_i -x_j\| \gtrsim N^{-1/2}$.

For your first question, ""What is the relationship between the magnitude of a frequency vector k and the behavior of the exponential sum?"", I think I can help you with that.

This question seems to be related to the title ""Exponential Sums and Riesz energies"". Let me see what I can find in that abstract.

 Ah-ha! According to the abstract, the relationship between the magnitude of a frequency vector k and the behavior of the exponential sum is that the exponential sum is bounded by a geometric quantity, specifically:

$$\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{ \frac{X^2}{1 + X^4 \|x_i -x_j\|^4}} \lesssim \sum_{k \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \atop \|k\| \leq X}{ \left| \sum_{n=1}^{N}{ e^{2 \pi i \left\langle k, x_n \right\rangle}}\right|^2} \lesssim \sum_{i,j=1}^{N}{ X^2 e^{-c X^2\|x_i -x_j\|^2}}.$$

In this bound, the magnitude of the frequency vector k (represented by ||k||) is directly related to the behavior of the exponential sum, specifically, the bound becomes tighter as ||k|| increases.",0.47836813

How does the amount of ultraviolet radiation experienced by a planet translate to atmospheric ablation?,ed061da3,"Title: A giant planet undergoing extreme ultraviolet irradiation by its hot massive-star host

        Abstract:   The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet
depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of
extra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that
transit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to
transit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature
of ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is
itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat
differential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,
traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the
temperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the
molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of
ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be
significantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report
observations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbital
period ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host star
is at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the
KELT-9b's day-side temperature to be ~4600K. This is as hot as stars of stellar
type K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus the
primary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likely
atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme
ultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,
leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet
largely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host
star.

condensates. Earlier works have illustrated the bifurcation of such states, in
the vicinity of the linear limit, for isotropic or anisotropic
three-dimensional harmonic traps. Here, we extend these states to the regime of
large chemical potentials, the so-called Thomas-Fermi limit, and explore their
properties such as equilibrium radii and inter-ring distance, for multi-ring
states, as well as their vibrational spectra and possible instabilities. In
this limit, both the existence and stability characteristics can be partially
traced to a particle picture that considers the rings as individual particles
oscillating within the trap and interacting pairwise with one another. Finally,

What are the main advantages of using a RHOMP model for predicting user actions in comparison to approaches like Kneser-Ney regularization and tensor factorizations?,1a4e3129,"Title: Retrospective Higher-Order Markov Processes for User Trails

        Abstract:   Users form information trails as they browse the web, checkin with a
geolocation, rate items, or consume media. A common problem is to predict what
a user might do next for the purposes of guidance, recommendation, or
prefetching. First-order and higher-order Markov chains have been widely used
methods to study such sequences of data. First-order Markov chains are easy to
estimate, but lack accuracy when history matters. Higher-order Markov chains,
in contrast, have too many parameters and suffer from overfitting the training
data. Fitting these parameters with regularization and smoothing only offers
mild improvements. In this paper we propose the retrospective higher-order
Markov process (RHOMP) as a low-parameter model for such sequences. This model
is a special case of a higher-order Markov chain where the transitions depend
retrospectively on a single history state instead of an arbitrary combination
of history states. There are two immediate computational advantages: the number
of parameters is linear in the order of the Markov chain and the model can be
fit to large state spaces. Furthermore, by providing a specific structure to
the higher-order chain, RHOMPs improve the model accuracy by efficiently
utilizing history states without risks of overfitting the data. We demonstrate
how to estimate a RHOMP from data and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on various real application datasets spanning geolocation data, review
sequences, and business locations. The RHOMP model uniformly outperforms
higher-order Markov chains, Kneser-Ney regularization, and tensor
factorizations in terms of prediction accuracy.

What are the limitations of using strong lensing observations to constrain cosmological parameters?,9dc57430,"Title: Reducing biases on $H_0$ measurements using strong lensing and galaxy dynamics: results from the EAGLE simulation

        Abstract:   Cosmological parameter constraints from observations of time-delay lenses are
becoming increasingly precise. However, there may be significant bias and
scatter in these measurements due to, among other things, the so-called
mass-sheet degeneracy. To estimate these uncertainties, we analyze strong
lenses from the largest EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a mass-sheet
transformation to the radial density profiles of lenses, and by selecting
lenses near isothermality, we find that the bias on H0 can be reduced to 5%
with an intrinsic scatter of 10%, confirming previous results performed on a
different simulation data set. We further investigate whether combining lensing
observables with kinematic constraints helps to minimize this bias. We do not
detect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or
observational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens
configuration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate
estimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased
low (high). With kinematic constraints, double lenses show bias and intrinsic
scatter of 6% and 10%, respectively, while quad lenses show bias and intrinsic
scatter of 0.5% and 10%, respectively. For lenses with a reduced $\chi^2 > 1$,
a power-law dependence of the $\chi^2$ on the lens environment (number of
nearby galaxies) is seen. Lastly, we model, in greater detail, the cases of two
double lenses that are significantly biased. We are able to remove the bias,
suggesting that the remaining biases could also be reduced by carefully taking
into account additional sources of systematic uncertainty.

Title: A Practical Bandit Method with Advantages in Neural Network Tuning

Abstract: Stochastic bandit algorithms can be used for challenging non-convex optimization problems. Hyperparameter tuning of neural networks is particularly challenging, necessitating new approaches. To this end, we present a method that adaptively partitions the combined space of hyperparameters, context, and training resources (e.g., total number of training iterations). By adaptively partitioning the space, the algorithm is able to focus on the portions of the hyperparameter search space that are most relevant in a practical way. By including the resources in the combined space, the method tends to use fewer training resources overall. Our experiments show that this method can surpass state-of-the-art methods in tuning neural networks on benchmark datasets. In some cases, our implementations can achieve the same levels of accuracy on benchmark datasets as existing state-of-the-art approaches while saving over 50% of our computational resources (e.g. time, training iterations).

this paper a new dam breach modeling framework is introduced that shall improve
the reliability of hydrograph predictions of homogeneous earthen embankment
dams. Striving for a small number of parameters, the simplified physics-based
model describes the processes of failing embankment dams by breach enlargement,
driven by progressive surface erosion. Therein the erosion rate of dam material
is modeled by empirical sediment transport formulations. Embedding the model
into a Bayesian multilevel framework allows for quantitative analysis of
different categories of uncertainties. To this end, data available in
literature of observed peak discharge and final breach width of historical dam
failures was used to perform model inversion by applying Markov Chain Monte
Carlo simulation. Prior knowledge is mainly based on non-informative
distribution functions. The resulting posterior distribution shows that the
main source of uncertainty is a correlated subset of parameters, consisting of
the residual error term and the epistemic term quantifying the breach erosion
rate. The prediction intervals of peak discharge and final breach width are
congruent with values known from literature. To finally predict the outflow
hydrograph for real case applications, an alternative residual model was
formulated that assumes perfect data and a perfect model. The fully

iridates. For the metallic iridate Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, the Ir $5d$ conduction
electrons interact with the Pr $4f$ local moments via the $f$-$d$ exchange.
While the Ir electrons form a Luttinger semimetal, the Pr moments can be tuned

the ordered spin ice of the Pr local moments generates an internal magnetic

the broad existence of Weyl nodes, we predict that the magnetic translation of
the ""Melko-Hertog-Gingras"" state for the Pr moments protects the Dirac band

without getting lost on their way to learning isogeny based cryptography. They
are by no means a reference text on the theory of elliptic curves, nor on
cryptography; students are encouraged to complement these notes with some of

Describe the horseshoe-like structure found in the infrared and millimeter images of the molecular cloud G35.20-0.74,0788e34c,"Title: Star Formation Activity in the molecular cloud G35.20$-$0.74: onset of cloud-cloud collision

        Abstract:   To probe the star-formation (SF) processes, we present results of an analysis
of the molecular cloud G35.20$-$0.74 (hereafter MCG35.2) using multi-frequency
observations. The MCG35.2 is depicted in a velocity range of 30-40 km s$^{-1}$.
An almost horseshoe-like structure embedded within the MCG35.2 is evident in
the infrared and millimeter images and harbors the previously known sites,
ultra-compact/hyper-compact G35.20$-$0.74N H\,{\sc ii} region, Ap2-1, and
Mercer 14 at its base. The site, Ap2-1 is found to be excited by a radio
spectral type of B0.5V star where the distribution of 20 cm and H$\alpha$
emission is surrounded by the extended molecular hydrogen emission. Using the
{\it Herschel} 160-500 $\mu$m and photometric 1-24 $\mu$m data analysis,
several embedded clumps and clusters of young stellar objects (YSOs) are
investigated within the MCG35.2, revealing the SF activities. Majority of the
YSOs clusters and massive clumps (500-4250 M$_{\odot}$) are seen toward the
horseshoe-like structure. The position-velocity analysis of $^{13}$CO emission
shows a blue-shifted peak (at 33 km s$^{-1}$) and a red-shifted peak (at 37 km
s$^{-1}$) interconnected by lower intensity intermediated velocity emission,
tracing a broad bridge feature. The presence of such broad bridge feature
suggests the onset of a collision between molecular components in the MCG35.2.
A noticeable change in the H-band starlight mean polarization angles has also
been observed in the MCG35.2, probably tracing the interaction between
molecular components. Taken together, it seems that the cloud-cloud collision
process has influenced the birth of massive stars and YSOs clusters in the
MCG35.2.

answered: 1) With the SERL, what is the performance of the harvested power at
the users ? 2) How do we configure the parameters to maximize the efficiency of
WPT? 3) Under the same constraints, does the DA-PB still have performance gain
than the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB)? First, the minimum antenna height of

power density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL
published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the
closed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user

to maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed

Abstract: The paper presents a Distributed Antenna Power Beacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where the antennas are uniformly distributed on a circle. The system is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation level (SERL) requirement. The performance of the harvested power at the users is investigated, and the parameters are configured to maximize the efficiency of WPT. The paper also compares the DA-PB system with the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB) system under the same constraints. The simulation results show that the DA-PB system achieves larger average harvested DC power than the CA-PB system, and improves the efficiency of WPT.",0.9130722
Can an a posteriori error bound for reduced linear time-periodic models be expressed in terms of related linear time-invariant systems?,b993ab04,"Title: Linear time-periodic dynamical systems: An H2 analysis and a model reduction framework

        Abstract:   Linear time-periodic (LTP) dynamical systems frequently appear in the
modeling of phenomena related to fluid dynamics, electronic circuits, and
structural mechanics via linearization centered around known periodic orbits of
nonlinear models. Such LTP systems can reach orders that make repeated
simulation or other necessary analysis prohibitive, motivating the need for
model reduction.
We develop here an algorithmic framework for constructing reduced models that
retains the linear time-periodic structure of the original LTP system. Our
approach generalizes optimal approaches that have been established previously
for linear time-invariant (LTI) model reduction problems. We employ an
extension of the usual H2 Hardy space defined for the LTI setting to
time-periodic systems and within this broader framework develop an a posteriori
error bound expressible in terms of related LTI systems. Optimization of this
bound motivates our algorithm. We illustrate the success of our method on two
numerical examples.

How does the exploration-exploitation trade-off affect population growth in changing environments?,26cf94e8,"Title: Exploration-exploitation tradeoffs dictate the optimal distributions of phenotypes for populations subject to fitness fluctuations

        Abstract:   We study a minimal model for the growth of a phenotypically heterogeneous
population of cells subject to a fluctuating environment in which they can
replicate (by exploiting available resources) and modify their phenotype within
a given landscape (thereby exploring novel configurations). The model displays
an exploration-exploitation trade-off whose specifics depend on the statistics
of the environment. Most notably, the phenotypic distribution corresponding to
maximum population fitness (i.e. growth rate) requires a non-zero exploration
rate when the magnitude of environmental fluctuations changes randomly over
time, while a purely exploitative strategy turns out to be optimal in two-state
environments, independently of the statistics of switching times. We obtain
analytical insight into the limiting cases of very fast and very slow
exploration rates by directly linking population growth to the features of the
environment.
","I can help you find an answer to your question! The exploration-exploitation trade-off is studied in the paper titled ""Exploration-exploitation tradeoffs dictate the optimal distributions of phenotypes for populations subject to fitness fluctuations"".

According to this paper, the exploration-exploitation trade-off affects population growth in changing environments as follows:

In a fluctuating environment, the population growth rate requires a non-zero exploration rate in order to adapt to the changing conditions. This means that the population needs to explore novel configurations and maintain a certain level of phenotypic diversity in order to respond to changes in the environment.

On the other hand, in a two-state environment where the environment switches between two fixed states, a purely exploitative strategy is optimal, regardless of the statistics of the switching times. This suggests that in stable environments, the population can focus on exploiting the available resources without the need for exploration.

In summary, the exploration-exploitation trade-off is a fundamental aspect of population growth in changing environments, and it dictates the optimal distribution of phenotypes that maximizes population fitness.

What conjecture related to Gromov-Hausdorff limits of Kähler-Einstein Fano manifolds is confirmed in this paper? ,76a77f10,"Title: Stability of Valuations: Higher Rational Rank

        Abstract:   Given a klt singularity $x\in (X, D)$, we show that a quasi-monomial

of the normalized volume function $\widehat{\rm vol}_{(X,D),x}$, if and only if
$v$ induces a degeneration to a K-semistable log Fano cone singularity.
Moreover, such a minimizer is unique among all quasi-monomial valuations up to

intermediate K-semistable cone associated to its metric tangent cone is
uniquely determined by the algebraic structure of $x\in X$, hence confirming a

What specific statistical principle is employed to generate more accurate approximate query results?,7ee775a2,"Title: Database Learning: Toward a Database that Becomes Smarter Every Time

        Abstract:   In today's databases, previous query answers rarely benefit answering future
queries. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we change this
paradigm in an approximate query processing (AQP) context. We make the
following observation: the answer to each query reveals some degree of
knowledge about the answer to another query because their answers stem from the
same underlying distribution that has produced the entire dataset. Exploiting
and refining this knowledge should allow us to answer queries more
analytically, rather than by reading enormous amounts of raw data. Also,
processing more queries should continuously enhance our knowledge of the
underlying distribution, and hence lead to increasingly faster response times
for future queries.
We call this novel idea---learning from past query answers---Database
Learning. We exploit the principle of maximum entropy to produce answers, which
are in expectation guaranteed to be more accurate than existing sample-based
approximations. Empowered by this idea, we build a query engine on top of Spark
SQL, called Verdict. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world query
traces from a large customer of a major database vendor. Our results
demonstrate that Verdict supports 73.7% of these queries, speeding them up by
up to 23.0x for the same accuracy level compared to existing AQP systems.

What is the potential impact of a mismatched resource provision and demand on cloud customer utility?,bacc490d,"Title: A Debt-Aware Learning Approach for Resource Adaptations in Cloud Elasticity Management

        Abstract:   Elasticity is a cloud property that enables applications and its execution
systems to dynamically acquire and release shared computational resources on
demand. Moreover, it unfolds the advantage of economies of scale in the cloud
through a drop in the average costs of these shared resources. However, it is
still an open challenge to achieve a perfect match between resource demand and
provision in autonomous elasticity management. Resource adaptation decisions
essentially involve a trade-off between economics and performance, which
produces a gap between the ideal and actual resource provisioning. This gap, if
not properly managed, can negatively impact the aggregate utility of a cloud
customer in the long run. To address this limitation, we propose a technical
debt-aware learning approach for autonomous elasticity management based on a
reinforcement learning of elasticity debts in resource provisioning; the
adaptation pursues strategic decisions that trades off economics against
performance. We extend CloudSim and Burlap to evaluate our approach. The
evaluation shows that a reinforcement learning of technical debts in elasticity
obtains a higher utility for a cloud customer, while conforming expected levels
of performance.

What is the name of the first end-to-end automated framework designed to protect Deep Learning models from malicious attacks?,ffdaedd9,"Title: DeepFense: Online Accelerated Defense Against Adversarial Deep Learning

        Abstract:   Recent advances in adversarial Deep Learning (DL) have opened up a largely
unexplored surface for malicious attacks jeopardizing the integrity of
autonomous DL systems. With the wide-spread usage of DL in critical and
time-sensitive applications, including unmanned vehicles, drones, and video
surveillance systems, online detection of malicious inputs is of utmost
importance. We propose DeepFense, the first end-to-end automated framework that
simultaneously enables efficient and safe execution of DL models. DeepFense
formalizes the goal of thwarting adversarial attacks as an optimization problem
that minimizes the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned
by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of
complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the
legitimacy of the input samples in parallel with the victim DL model. DeepFense
leverages hardware/software/algorithm co-design and customized acceleration to
achieve just-in-time performance in resource-constrained settings. The proposed
countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged
to train modular redundancies. We further provide an accompanying API to reduce
the non-recurring engineering cost and ensure automated adaptation to various
platforms. Extensive evaluations on FPGAs and GPUs demonstrate up to two orders
of magnitude performance improvement while enabling online adversarial sample
detection.

What algorithms are used to manage spectrum access in a multi-user environment where the number of users is unknown?,9e452d96,"Title: Multi-User Multi-Armed Bandits for Uncoordinated Spectrum Access

        Abstract:   A multi-user multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is used to develop algorithms
for uncoordinated spectrum access. The number of users is assumed to be unknown
to each user. A stochastic setting is first considered, where the rewards on a
channel are the same for each user. In contrast to prior work, it is assumed
that the number of users can possibly exceed the number of channels, and that
rewards can be non-zero even under collisions. The proposed algorithm consists
of an estimation phase and an allocation phase. It is shown that if every user
adopts the algorithm, the system wide regret is constant with time with high

in particular, even when the number of users is less than the number of

the rewards on the channels are user-dependent. It is assumed that the number
of users is less than the number of channels, and that the users receive zero
reward on collision. The proposed algorithm combines the Exp3.P algorithm
developed in prior work for single user adversarial bandits with a collision
resolution mechanism to achieve sub-linear regret. It is shown that if every
user employs the proposed algorithm, the system wide regret is of the order
$O(T^\frac{3}{4})$ over a horizon of time $T$. The algorithms in both
stochastic and adversarial scenarios are extended to the dynamic case where the
number of users in the system evolves over time and are shown to lead to
sub-linear regret.

How does a minimal model of self-supervised learning explain the use of sensor cue fusion?,477c7ab8,"Title: Self-supervised learning: When is fusion of the primary and secondary sensor cue useful?

Does the abstract find a causal link between moral preferences and behavior in the Ultimatum Game?,ae574768,"Title: Social versus Moral preferences in the Ultimatum Game: A theoretical model and an experiment

allocate a certain amount of money between herself and a ""responder"". If the
offer is greater than or equal to the responder's minimum acceptable offer
(MAO), then the money is split as proposed, otherwise, neither the proposer nor
the responder get anything. The UG has intrigued generations of behavioral
scientists because people in experiments blatantly violate the equilibrium
predictions that self-interested proposers offer the minimum available non-zero
amount, and self-interested responders accept. Why are these predictions
violated? Previous research has mainly focused on the role of social
preferences. Little is known about the role of general moral preferences for
doing the right thing, preferences that have been shown to play a major role in
other social interactions (e.g., Dictator Game and Prisoner's Dilemma). Here I
develop a theoretical model and an experiment designed to pit social
preferences against moral preferences. I find that, although people recognize
that offering half and rejecting low offers are the morally right things to do,
moral preferences have no causal impact on UG behavior. The experimental data
are indeed well fit by a model according to which: (i) high UG offers are
motivated by inequity aversion and, to a lesser extent, self-interest; (ii)
high MAOs are motivated by inequity aversion.

Title: Identification of microRNA clusters cooperatively acting on Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Triple Negative Breast Cancer

Abstract: MicroRNAs play important roles in many biological processes. Their aberrant expression can have oncogenic or tumor suppressor function directly participating to carcinogenesis, malignant transformation, invasiveness and metastasis. Indeed, miRNA profiles can distinguish not only between normal and cancerous tissue but they can also successfully classify different subtypes of a particular cancer. Here, we focus on a particular class of transcripts encoding polycistronic miRNA genes that yields multiple miRNA components. We describe clustered MiRNA Master Regulator Analysis (ClustMMRA), a fully redesigned release of the MMRA computational pipeline (MiRNA Master Regulator Analysis), developed to search for clustered miRNAs potentially driving cancer molecular subtyping. Genomically clustered miRNAs are frequently co-expressed to target different components of pro-tumorigenic signalling pathways. By applying ClustMMRA to breast cancer patient data, we identified key miRNA clusters driving the phenotype of different tumor subgroups. The pipeline was applied to two independent breast cancer datasets, providing statistically concordant results between the two analysis. We validated in cell lines the miR-199/miR-214 as a novel cluster of miRNAs promoting the triple negative subtype phenotype through its control of proliferation and EMT.",0.91696227

How do neural networks process information from multiple sensory systems?,d3a2d47b,"Title: Closing the loop on multisensory interactions: A neural architecture for multisensory causal inference and recalibration

        Abstract:   When the brain receives input from multiple sensory systems, it is faced with
the question of whether it is appropriate to process the inputs in combination,
as if they originated from the same event, or separately, as if they originated
from distinct events. Furthermore, it must also have a mechanism through which
it can keep sensory inputs calibrated to maintain the accuracy of its internal
representations. We have developed a neural network architecture capable of i)
approximating optimal multisensory spatial integration, based on Bayesian
causal inference, and ii) recalibrating the spatial encoding of sensory
systems. The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing
hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and
the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons.
Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play
dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates
and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of
multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections
spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding

How does a sparsified-dynamics model compare to other reduced-order models for vortex simulations?,8a9d659e,"Title: Network-theoretic approach to sparsified discrete vortex dynamics

        Abstract:   We examine discrete vortex dynamics in two-dimensional flow through a

a graph, which allows the use of network-theoretic approaches to identify key
vortex-to-vortex interactions. We employ sparsification techniques on these

Identification of vortex structures based on graph sparsification and sparse
vortex dynamics are illustrated through an example of point-vortex clusters

sparsification with increasing number of point vortices. The
sparsified-dynamics model developed with spectral graph theory requires reduced

The results show that the sparsified model requires a reduced number of vortex-to-vortex interactions but still agrees well with the full nonlinear dynamics.

2. **Comparison with Reduced-Order Models**: The sparsified-dynamics model is not explicitly compared with other reduced-order models in the provided papers. However, reduced-order models are mentioned in the paper ""A global sensitivity analysis and reduced order models for hydraulically-fractured horizontal wells"", where the authors provide reduced order models (ROMs) to replace complex numerical models.

What types of errors were most frequently found in uplifted patches that caused issues?,bd3013b7,"Title: Is It Safe to Uplift This Patch? An Empirical Study on Mozilla Firefox

        Abstract:   In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or
implement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development
channel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more
stabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is
risky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end
up introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift
operations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted
patches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we
quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift
decisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced
regressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to
understand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and
outcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong
functionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have
larger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors
in the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift
requests that concern certain specific components, and-or that are submitted by
certain specific developers.

        Abstract:   Beam search is a desirable choice of test-time decoding algorithm for neural
sequence models because it potentially avoids search errors made by simpler

models do not directly consider the behaviour of the final decoding method. As
a result, for cross-entropy trained models, beam decoding can sometimes yield
reduced test performance when compared with greedy decoding. In order to train
models that can more effectively make use of beam search, we propose a new
training procedure that focuses on the final loss metric (e.g. Hamming loss)
evaluated on the output of beam search. While well-defined, this ""direct loss""
objective is itself discontinuous and thus difficult to optimize. Hence, in our
approach, we form a sub-differentiable surrogate objective by introducing a
novel continuous approximation of the beam search decoding procedure. In

In this paper we consider a marginal sensitivity model which is a natural extension of Rosenbaum's sensitivity model that is widely used for matched observational studies. We aim to construct confidence intervals based on inverse probability weighting estimators, such that asymptotically the intervals have at least nominal coverage of the estimand whenever the data generating distribution is in the collection of marginal sensitivity models. We use a percentile bootstrap and a generalized minimax/maximin inequality to transform this intractable problem to a linear fractional programming problem, which can be solved very efficiently.

This paper discusses the extension of sensitivity analysis to inverse probability weighting estimators. It presents a method for constructing confidence intervals based on inverse probability weighting estimators, ensuring that the intervals have at least nominal coverage of the estimand whenever the data generating distribution is contained within the collection of marginal sensitivity models.",0.9709672

What criteria does this approach use to determine how classes are merged in the tree?,a0eea4fb,"Title: Fast Meta-Learning for Adaptive Hierarchical Classifier Design

        Abstract:   We propose a new splitting criterion for a meta-learning approach to
multiclass classifier design that adaptively merges the classes into a
tree-structured hierarchy of increasingly difficult binary classification
problems. The classification tree is constructed from empirical estimates of
the Henze-Penrose bounds on the pairwise Bayes misclassification rates that
rank the binary subproblems in terms of difficulty of classification. The
proposed empirical estimates of the Bayes error rate are computed from the
minimal spanning tree (MST) of the samples from each pair of classes. Moreover,
a meta-learning technique is presented for quantifying the one-vs-rest Bayes
error rate for each individual class from a single MST on the entire dataset.
Extensive simulations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed hierarchical
method can often be learned much faster than competing methods, while achieving
competitive accuracy.

Why are existing evaluations of ZIP and ZIA schemes limited?,fb571ac1,"Title: Perils of Zero-Interaction Security in the Internet of Things

        Abstract:   The Internet of Things (IoT) demands authentication systems which can provide
both security and usability. Recent research utilizes the rich sensing
capabilities of smart devices to build security schemes operating without human
interaction, such as zero-interaction pairing (ZIP) and zero-interaction
authentication (ZIA). Prior work proposed a number of ZIP and ZIA schemes and
reported promising results. However, those schemes were often evaluated under
conditions which do not reflect realistic IoT scenarios. In addition, drawing
any comparison among the existing schemes is impossible due to the lack of a
common public dataset and unavailability of scheme implementations.
In this paper, we address these challenges by conducting the first
large-scale comparative study of ZIP and ZIA schemes, carried out under
realistic conditions. We collect and release the most comprehensive dataset in
the domain to date, containing over 4250 hours of audio recordings and 1
billion sensor readings from three different scenarios, and evaluate five
state-of-the-art schemes based on these data. Our study reveals that the
effectiveness of the existing proposals is highly dependent on the scenario
they are used in. In particular, we show that these schemes are subject to

What novel protocol is proposed in the paper to address the inaccuracies in NTA size measurements of extracellular vesicles (EVs)?,1673853e,"Title: The effects of subdiffusion on the NTA size measurements of extracellular vesicles in biological samples

        Abstract:   The interest in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as they
became reliable biomarkers for many diseases. For this reason, fast and
accurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost
importance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their
diffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA
follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement
(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\propto t$). However, we show
that NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples,
i.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour
(MSD $\propto t^\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$). To support this observation we present
a range of experimental results for both polystyrene beads and EVs. This is
also related to another problem: for the same samples there exists a huge
discrepancy (by the factor of 2-4) between the sizes measured with NTA and with
the direct imaging methods, such as AFM. This can be remedied by e.g. the
Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is
limited in the biological and poly-disperse samples. On the other hand, the
models of sub-diffusion rarely provide the direct relation between the size of
a particle and the generalized diffusion constant. However, we solve this last
problem by introducing the logarithmic model of sub-diffusion, aimed at
retrieving the size data. In result, we propose a novel protocol of NTA data
analysis. The accuracy of our method is on par with FTLA for small
($\simeq$200nm) particles. We apply our method to study the EVs samples and
corroborate the results with AFM.

functions, allowing for sharper analysis of optimal policies and more efficient

What magnetic topology features were observed in the three particularly slow rotating dwarf stars studied?,7b1a2368,"Title: SPIRou Input Catalog: Activity, Rotation and Magnetic Field of Cool Dwarfs

        Abstract:   Based on optical high-resolution spectra obtained with CFHT/ESPaDOnS, we
present new measurements of activity and magnetic field proxies of 442 low-mass
K5-M7 dwarfs. The objects were analysed as potential targets to search for
planetary-mass companions with the new spectropolarimeter and high-precision
velocimeter, SPIRou. We have analysed their high-resolution spectra in an
homogeneous way: circular polarisation, chromospheric features, and Zeeman
broadening of the FeH infrared line. The complex relationship between these
activity indicators is analysed: while no strong connection is found between
the large-scale and small-scale magnetic fields, the latter relates with the
non-thermal flux originating in the chromosphere.
We then examine the relationship between various activity diagnostics and the
optical radial-velocity jitter available in the literature, especially for
planet host stars. We use this to derive for all stars an activity merit
function (higher for quieter stars) with the goal of identifying the most
favorable stars where the radial-velocity jitter is low enough for planet
searches. We find that the main contributors to the RV jitter are the
large-scale magnetic field and the chromospheric non-thermal emission.
In addition, three stars (GJ 1289, GJ 793, and GJ 251) have been followed
along their rotation using the spectropolarimetric mode, and we derive their

"In adversarial multi-user MAB scenarios, how is collision resolution incorporated into the algorithm design for spectrum access?",9e452d96,"Title: Multi-User Multi-Armed Bandits for Uncoordinated Spectrum Access

        Abstract:   A multi-user multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is used to develop algorithms
for uncoordinated spectrum access. The number of users is assumed to be unknown
to each user. A stochastic setting is first considered, where the rewards on a
channel are the same for each user. In contrast to prior work, it is assumed
that the number of users can possibly exceed the number of channels, and that
rewards can be non-zero even under collisions. The proposed algorithm consists
of an estimation phase and an allocation phase. It is shown that if every user
adopts the algorithm, the system wide regret is constant with time with high
probability. The regret guarantees hold for any number of users and channels,
in particular, even when the number of users is less than the number of
channels. Next, an adversarial multi-user MAB framework is considered, where
the rewards on the channels are user-dependent. It is assumed that the number
of users is less than the number of channels, and that the users receive zero
reward on collision. The proposed algorithm combines the Exp3.P algorithm
developed in prior work for single user adversarial bandits with a collision
resolution mechanism to achieve sub-linear regret. It is shown that if every
user employs the proposed algorithm, the system wide regret is of the order
$O(T^\frac{3}{4})$ over a horizon of time $T$. The algorithms in both
stochastic and adversarial scenarios are extended to the dynamic case where the
number of users in the system evolves over time and are shown to lead to
sub-linear regret.

What are the key axioms that define a tangle?,77d735a2,"Title: Tangle-tree duality in abstract separation systems

        Abstract:   We prove a general width duality theorem for combinatorial structures with
well-defined notions of cohesion and separation. These might be graphs and
matroids, but can be much more general or quite different. The theorem asserts
a duality between the existence of high cohesiveness somewhere local and a
global overall tree structure.
We describe cohesive substructures in a unified way in the format of tangles:
as orientations of low-order separations satisfying certain consistency axioms.
These axioms can be expressed without reference to the underlying structure,
such as a graph or matroid, but just in terms of the poset of the separations
themselves. This makes it possible to identify tangles, and apply our
tangle-tree duality theorem, in very diverse settings.
Our result implies all the classical duality theorems for width parameters in
graph minor theory, such as path-width, tree-width, branch-width or rank-width.
It yields new, tangle-type, duality theorems for tree-width and path-width. It
implies the existence of width parameters dual to cohesive substructures such
as $k$-blocks, edge-tangles, or given subsets of tangles, for which no width
duality theorems were previously known.
Abstract separation systems can be found also in structures quite unlike
graphs and matroids. For example, our theorem can be applied to image analysis
by capturing the regions of an image as tangles of separations defined as
natural partitions of its set of pixels. It can be applied in big data contexts
by capturing clusters as tangles. It can be applied in the social sciences,
e.g. by capturing as tangles the few typical mindsets of individuals found by a
survey. It could also be applied in pure mathematics, e.g. to separations of
compact manifolds.

What methods are used to observe and record the behavior of liquid metal in a simulated microgravity environment? ,50599abe,"Title: Synchronous Observation on the Spontaneous Transformation of Liquid Metal under Free Falling Microgravity Situation

        Abstract:   The unusually high surface tension of room temperature liquid metal is
molding it as unique material for diverse newly emerging areas. However, unlike
its practices on earth, such metal fluid would display very different behaviors
when working in space where gravity disappears and surface property dominates
the major physics. So far, few direct evidences are available to understand
such effect which would impede further exploration of liquid metal use for
space. Here to preliminarily probe into this intriguing issue, a low cost
experimental strategy to simulate microgravity environment on earth was
proposed through adopting bridges with high enough free falling distance as the
test platform. Then using digital cameras amounted along x, y, z directions on
outside wall of the transparent container with liquid metal and allied solution
inside, synchronous observations on the transient flow and transformational
activities of liquid metal were performed. Meanwhile, an unmanned aerial
vehicle was adopted to record the whole free falling dynamics of the test
capsule from the far end which can help justify subsequent experimental
procedures. A series of typical fundamental phenomena were thus observed as:
(a) A relatively large liquid metal object would spontaneously transform from
its original planar pool state into a sphere and float in the container if
initiating the free falling; (b) The liquid metal changes its three-dimensional
shape due to dynamic microgravity strength due to free falling and rebound of
the test capsule; and (c) A quick spatial transformation of liquid metal
immersed in the solution can easily be induced via external electrical fields.
The mechanisms of the surface tension driven liquid metal actuation in space
were interpreted. All these findings indicated that microgravity effect should
be fully treated in developing future generation liquid metal space
technologies.

        Abstract:   We obtain the non-linear generalization of the Sachs-Wolfe + integrated
Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) formula describing the CMB temperature anisotropies. Our
formula is valid at all orders in perturbation theory, is also valid in all
gauges and includes scalar, vector and tensor modes. A direct consequence of
our results is that the maps of the logarithmic temperature anisotropies are
much cleaner than the usual CMB maps, because they automatically remove many
secondary anisotropies. This can for instance, facilitate the search for
primordial non-Gaussianity in future works. It also disentangles the non-linear
ISW from other effects. Finally, we provide a method which can iteratively be
used to obtain the lensing solution at the desired order.

stellar surface, (iii) disk formation around the star. We explore the parameter
space of the three different regimes and find that at low eccentricities,
$e\lesssim 0.2$, mass overflow leads to disk formation for most systems, while
for higher eccentricities or retrograde orbits self-accretion is the only

accreted by the star is not always valid.

How was the performance of a deep multi-user reinforcement learning algorithm for spectrum access evaluated?,8b86ca59,"Title: Deep Multi-User Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Access

        Abstract:   We consider the problem of dynamic spectrum access for network utility
maximization in multichannel wireless networks. The shared bandwidth is divided
into K orthogonal channels. In the beginning of each time slot, each user
selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain transmission
probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet
receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully
delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is a multi-user strategy for
accessing the spectrum that maximizes a certain network utility in a
distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between
users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is
computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial
observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel
distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user
reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its
current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used
to maximize the objective function. Game theoretic analysis of the system

of the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of the

state, exponentially fast under appropriate assumptions, and provide an
explicit expression of the convergence rate.

What are the limitations of using high-level music representations for realistic music generation?,35f285fc,"Title: The challenge of realistic music generation: modelling raw audio at scale

        Abstract:   Realistic music generation is a challenging task. When building generative
models of music that are learnt from data, typically high-level representations
such as scores or MIDI are used that abstract away the idiosyncrasies of a
particular performance. But these nuances are very important for our perception
of musicality and realism, so in this work we embark on modelling music in the
raw audio domain. It has been shown that autoregressive models excel at
generating raw audio waveforms of speech, but when applied to music, we find
them biased towards capturing local signal structure at the expense of
modelling long-range correlations. This is problematic because music exhibits
structure at many different timescales. In this work, we explore autoregressive
discrete autoencoders (ADAs) as a means to enable autoregressive models to
capture long-range correlations in waveforms. We find that they allow us to
unconditionally generate piano music directly in the raw audio domain, which
shows stylistic consistency across tens of seconds.

What types of random planar maps have their Tutte embeddings proven to converge to gamma-Liouville quantum gravity?,208a81fb,"Title: The Tutte embedding of the mated-CRT map converges to Liouville quantum gravity

        Abstract:   We prove that the Tutte embeddings (a.k.a. harmonic/embeddings) of certain
random planar maps converge to $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity
($\gamma$-LQG). Specifically, we treat mated-CRT maps, which are discretized
matings of correlated continuum random trees, and $\gamma$ ranges from $0$ to
$2$ as one varies the correlation parameter. We also show that the associated
space-filling path on the embedded map converges to space-filling
SLE$_{\kappa}$ for $\kappa =16/\gamma^2$ (in the annealed sense) and that
simple random walk on the embedded map converges to Brownian motion (in the
quenched sense). Our arguments also yield analogous statements for the Smith
(square tiling) embedding of the mated-CRT map.
This work constitutes the first proof that a discrete conformal embedding of
a random planar map converges to LQG. Many more such statements have been
conjectured. Since the mated-CRT map can be viewed as a coarse-grained
approximation to other random planar maps (the UIPT, tree-weighted maps,
bipolar-oriented maps, etc.), our results indicate a potential approach for
proving that embeddings of these maps converge to LQG as well.
To prove the main result, we establish several (independently interesting)
theorems about LQG surfaces decorated by space-filling SLE. There is a natural
way to use the SLE curve to divide the plane into `cells' corresponding to
vertices of the mated-CRT map. We study the law of the shape of the
origin-containing cell, in particular proving moments for the ratio of its
squared diameter to its area. We also give bounds on the degree of the
origin-containing cell and establish a form of ergodicity for the entire
configuration. Ultimately, we use these properties to show (using a general
theorem proved in a separate paper) that random walk on these cells converges
to a time change of Brownian motion, which in turn leads to the Tutte embedding
result.

In what type of flow regime were barchan dunes formed in a closed conduit experiment?,fa338c57,"Title: Birth of a subaqueous barchan dune

conical heaps in a rectangular channel. Because the most unique feature of a
barchan dune is its horns, we associate the timescale for the appearance of
horns to the formation of a barchan dune. A granular heap initially conical was
placed on the bottom wall of a closed conduit and it was entrained by a water
flow in turbulent regime. After a certain time, horns appear and grow, until an
equilibrium length is reached. Our results show the existence of the timescales
$0.5t_c$ and $2.5t_c$ for the appearance and equilibrium of horns,

What are the byproducts of the Higgs mode decay in the studied antiferromagnet?,988bc737,"Title: Higgs mode and its decay in a two dimensional antiferromagnet

        Abstract:   Condensed-matter analogs of the Higgs boson in particle physics allow
insights into its behavior in different symmetries and dimensionalities.
Evidence for the Higgs mode has been reported in a number of different
settings, including ultracold atomic gases, disordered superconductors, and
dimerized quantum magnets. However, decay processes of the Higgs mode (which
are eminently important in particle physics) have not yet been studied in
condensed matter due to the lack of a suitable material system coupled to a
direct experimental probe. A quantitative understanding of these processes is
particularly important for low-dimensional systems where the Higgs mode decays
rapidly and has remained elusive to most experimental probes. Here, we discover
and study the Higgs mode in a two-dimensional antiferromagnet using
spin-polarized inelastic neutron scattering. Our spin-wave spectra of
Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ directly reveal a well-defined, dispersive Higgs mode, which
quickly decays into transverse Goldstone modes at the antiferromagnetic
ordering wavevector. Through a complete mapping of the transverse modes in the
reciprocal space, we uniquely specify the minimal model Hamiltonian and
describe the decay process. We thus establish a novel condensed matter platform
for research on the dynamics of the Higgs mode.

"Besides generating fluid simulations, what other applications are enabled by this generative model?",7a72be56,"Title: Deep Fluids: A Generative Network for Parameterized Fluid Simulations

        Abstract:   This paper presents a novel generative model to synthesize fluid simulations
from a set of reduced parameters. A convolutional neural network is trained on
a collection of discrete, parameterizable fluid simulation velocity fields. Due
to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative
features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate
the training data set, while providing plausible interpolated in-betweens. The
proposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that
guarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we
demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and
advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second
network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling
applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids
with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and
compression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are
generated up to 700x faster than traditional CPU solvers, while achieving
compression rates of over 1300x.

What biological phenomenon inspired the development of a mathematical model for two-species particle flow with a bottleneck?,d5454239,"Title: Interference of two co-directional exclusion processes in the presence of a static bottleneck: a biologically motivated model

        Abstract:   We develope a two-species exclusion process with a distinct pair of entry and
exit sites for each species of rigid rods. The relatively slower forward
stepping of the rods in an extended bottleneck region, located in between the
two entry sites, controls the extent of interference of the co-directional flow
of the two species of rods. The relative positions of the sites of entry of the
two species of rods with respect to the location of the bottleneck are
motivated by a biological phenomenon. However, the primary focus of the study
here is to explore the effects of the interference of the flow of the two
species of rods on their spatio-temporal organization and the regulations of
this interference by the extended bottleneck. By a combination of mean-field
theory and computer simulation we calculate the flux of both species of rods
and their density profiles as well as the composite phase diagrams of the
system. If the bottleneck is sufficiently stringent some of the phases become
practically unrealizable although not ruled out on the basis of any fundamental
physical principle. Moreover the extent of suppression of flow of the
downstream entrants by the flow of the upstream entrants can also be regulated
by the strength of the bottleneck. We speculate on the possible implications of
the results in the context of the biological phenomenon that motivated the
formulation of the theoretical model.

What does the tangle-tree duality theorem assert about the relationship between local cohesiveness and global tree structure?,77d735a2,"Title: Tangle-tree duality in abstract separation systems

a duality between the existence of high cohesiveness somewhere local and a
global overall tree structure.
We describe cohesive substructures in a unified way in the format of tangles:
as orientations of low-order separations satisfying certain consistency axioms.
These axioms can be expressed without reference to the underlying structure,
such as a graph or matroid, but just in terms of the poset of the separations
themselves. This makes it possible to identify tangles, and apply our
tangle-tree duality theorem, in very diverse settings.
Our result implies all the classical duality theorems for width parameters in
graph minor theory, such as path-width, tree-width, branch-width or rank-width.
It yields new, tangle-type, duality theorems for tree-width and path-width. It
implies the existence of width parameters dual to cohesive substructures such
as $k$-blocks, edge-tangles, or given subsets of tangles, for which no width
duality theorems were previously known.
Abstract separation systems can be found also in structures quite unlike
graphs and matroids. For example, our theorem can be applied to image analysis
by capturing the regions of an image as tangles of separations defined as
natural partitions of its set of pixels. It can be applied in big data contexts
by capturing clusters as tangles. It can be applied in the social sciences,
e.g. by capturing as tangles the few typical mindsets of individuals found by a
survey. It could also be applied in pure mathematics, e.g. to separations of
compact manifolds.

fibers and fillers come out as a by-product of the paper manufacturing process
and mostly goes as waste. The job of an efficient Krofta supracell is to
separate the unwanted materials from the valuable ones so that fibers and
fillers can be collected from the waste materials and reused in the
manufacturing process. The efficiency of Krofta depends on several crucial
process parameters and monitoring them is a difficult proposition. To solve
this problem, we propose a novel hybridization of regression trees (RT) and
artificial neural networks (ANN), hybrid RT-ANN model, to solve the problem of
low recovery percentage of the supracell. This model is used to achieve the
goal of improving supracell efficiency, viz., gain in percentage recovery. In

Title: A novel distribution-free hybrid regression model for manufacturing process efficiency improvement

Abstract: This work is motivated by a particular problem of a modern paper manufacturing industry, in which maximum efficiency of the fiber-filler recovery process is desired. A lot of unwanted materials along with valuable fibers and fillers come out as a by-product of the paper manufacturing process and mostly goes as waste. The job of an efficient Krofta supracell is to separate the unwanted materials from the valuable ones so that fibers and fillers can be collected from the waste materials and reused in the manufacturing process. The efficiency of Krofta depends on several crucial process parameters and monitoring them is a difficult proposition. To solve this problem, we propose a novel hybridization of regression trees (RT) and artificial neural networks (ANN), hybrid RT-ANN model, to solve the problem of low recovery percentage of the supracell. This model is used to achieve the goal of improving supracell efficiency, viz., gain in percentage recovery. In addition, theoretical results for the universal consistency of the proposed model are given with the optimal value of a vital model parameter. Experimental findings show that the proposed hybrid RT-ANN model achieves higher accuracy in predicting Krofta recovery percentage than other conventional regression models for solving the Krofta efficiency problem. This work will help the paper manufacturing company to become environmentally friendly with minimal ecological damage and improved waste recovery.",0.9221459
What is the relationship between archetypal analysis and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)?,b5e1967c,"Title: Non-negative Matrix Factorization via Archetypal Analysis

        Abstract:   Given a collection of data points, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)
suggests to express them as convex combinations of a small set of `archetypes'
with non-negative entries. This decomposition is unique only if the true
archetypes are non-negative and sufficiently sparse (or the weights are
sufficiently sparse), a regime that is captured by the separability condition
and its generalizations.
In this paper, we study an approach to NMF that can be traced back to the
work of Cutler and Breiman (1994) and does not require the data to be
separable, while providing a generally unique decomposition. We optimize the
trade-off between two objectives: we minimize the distance of the data points
from the convex envelope of the archetypes (which can be interpreted as an
empirical risk), while minimizing the distance of the archetypes from the
convex envelope of the data (which can be interpreted as a data-dependent
regularization). The archetypal analysis method of (Cutler, Breiman, 1994) is
recovered as the limiting case in which the last term is given infinite weight.
We introduce a `uniqueness condition' on the data which is necessary for
exactly recovering the archetypes from noiseless data. We prove that, under
uniqueness (plus additional regularity conditions on the geometry of the
archetypes), our estimator is robust. While our approach requires solving a
non-convex optimization problem, we find that standard optimization methods
succeed in finding good solutions both for real and synthetic data.

What are some examples of recent successful methods for model compression beyond parameter pruning and sharing?,db40eb59,"Title: A Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration for Deep Neural Networks

        Abstract:   Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently achieved great
success in many visual recognition tasks. However, existing deep neural network
models are computationally expensive and memory intensive, hindering their
deployment in devices with low memory resources or in applications with strict
latency requirements. Therefore, a natural thought is to perform model
compression and acceleration in deep networks without significantly decreasing
the model performance. During the past few years, tremendous progress has been
made in this area. In this paper, we survey the recent advanced techniques for
compacting and accelerating CNNs model developed. These techniques are roughly
categorized into four schemes: parameter pruning and sharing, low-rank
factorization, transferred/compact convolutional filters, and knowledge
distillation. Methods of parameter pruning and sharing will be described at the
beginning, after that the other techniques will be introduced. For each scheme,
we provide insightful analysis regarding the performance, related applications,

Abstract: A simple DNA-based data storage scheme is demonstrated in which information is written using ""addressing"" oligonucleotides. In contrast to other methods that allow arbitrary code to be stored, the resulting DNA is suitable for downstream enzymatic and biological processing. This capability is crucial for DNA computers, and may allow for a diverse array of computational operations to be carried out using this DNA.

Title: Automatic Analysis, Decomposition and Parallel Optimization of Large Homogeneous Networks

Abstract: The life of the modern world essentially depends on the work of the large artificial homogeneous networks, such as wired and wireless communication systems, networks of roads and pipelines. The support of their effective continuous functioning requires automatic screening and permanent optimization with processing of the huge amount of data by high-performance distributed systems. We propose new meta-algorithm of large homogeneous network analysis, its decomposition into alternative sets of loosely connected subnets, and parallel optimization of the most independent elements. This algorithm is based on a network-specific correlation function, Simulated Annealing technique, and is adapted to work in the computer cluster. On the example of large wireless network, we show that proposed algorithm essentially increases speed of parallel optimization. The elaborated general approach can be used for analysis and optimization of the wide range of networks, including such specific types as artificial neural networks or organized in networks physiological systems of living organisms.

How does a multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform address the shortcomings of the conventional GFT for signals with directional characteristics? ,bec9f6fe,"Title: Multi-dimensional Graph Fourier Transform

These signals are ""multi-dimensional"" and have directional characteristics
along each factor graph. However, the existing graph Fourier transform does not
distinguish these directions, and assigns 1-D spectra to signals on product
graphs. Further, these spectra are often multi-valued at some frequencies. Our
main result is a multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform that solves such
problems associated with the conventional GFT. Using algebraic properties of
Cartesian products, the proposed transform rearranges 1-D spectra obtained by
the conventional GFT into the multi-dimensional frequency domain, of which each

multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform enables directional frequency
analysis, in addition to frequency analysis with the conventional GFT.
Moreover, this rearrangement resolves the multi-valuedness of spectra in some
cases. The multi-dimensional graph Fourier transform is a foundation of novel
filterings and stationarities that utilize dimensional information of graph
signals, which are also discussed in this study. The proposed methods are
applicable to a wide variety of data that can be regarded as signals on

natural definitions of the multivariate graph Fourier transform and the

Can the block bootstrap be validated under weakened assumptions for various dependence settings?,ac24635f,"Title: Convolved subsampling estimation with applications to block bootstrap

        Abstract:   The block bootstrap approximates sampling distributions from dependent data
by resampling data blocks. A fundamental problem is establishing its
consistency for the distribution of a sample mean, as a prototypical statistic.
We use a structural relationship with subsampling to characterize the bootstrap
in a new and general manner. While subsampling and block bootstrap differ, the
block bootstrap distribution of a sample mean equals that of a $k$-fold
self-convolution of a subsampling distribution. Motivated by this, we provide
simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a convolved subsampling
estimator to produce a normal limit that matches the target of bootstrap
estimation. These conditions may be linked to consistency properties of an
original subsampling distribution, which are often obtainable under minimal
assumptions. Through several examples, the results are shown to validate the
block bootstrap for means under significantly weakened assumptions in many
existing (and some new) dependence settings, which also addresses a standing
conjecture of Politis, Romano and Wolf(1999). Beyond sample means, the
convolved subsampling estimator may not match the block bootstrap, but instead
provides a hybrid-resampling estimator of interest in its own right. For
general statistics with normal limits, results also establish the consistency
of convolved subsampling under minimal dependence conditions, including
non-stationarity.

**Title: Data-Driven Sparse Structure Selection for Deep Neural Networks**

Abstract: ...In this paper, we propose a simple and effective framework to learn and prune deep models in an end-to-end manner. In our framework, a new type of parameter -- scaling factor is first introduced to scale the outputs of specific structures, such as neurons, groups or residual blocks. Then we add sparsity regularizations on these factors, and solve this optimization problem by a modified stochastic Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method. By forcing some of the factors to zero, we can safely remove the corresponding structures, thus prune the unimportant parts of a CNN.

**Title: Minimal Effort Back Propagation for Convolutional Neural Networks**

Abstract: ...In this paper we extend this technique [of computing only a small subset of the full gradients to update the model parameters] into the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to reduce calculation in back propagation, and the surprising results verify its validity in CNN: only 5% of the gradients are passed back but the model still achieves the same effect as the traditional CNN, or even better.

These papers discuss various methods for reducing the size and computational cost of deep neural networks, such as parameter pruning, low-rank factorization, knowledge distillation, and sparse structure selection. These techniques can help alleviate the computational expenses associated with training and deploying deep learning models, while maintaining their performance.

How can attention mechanisms be used to improve network pruning?,0ac14a18,"Title: Attention-Based Guided Structured Sparsity of Deep Neural Networks

In most of the conducted research efforts, the sparsity is enforced for network
pruning without any attention to the internal network characteristics such as

What are the limitations of retrieving a backbone in weighted Maximum Satisfiability problems?,08862526,"Title: Approximating the Backbone in the Weighted Maximum Satisfiability Problem

        Abstract:   The weighted Maximum Satisfiability problem (weighted MAX-SAT) is a NP-hard
problem with numerous applications arising in artificial intelligence. As an
efficient tool for heuristic design, the backbone has been applied to
heuristics design for many NP-hard problems. In this paper, we investigated the
computational complexity for retrieving the backbone in weighted MAX-SAT and
developed a new algorithm for solving this problem. We showed that it is
intractable to retrieve the full backbone under the assumption that . Moreover,
it is intractable to retrieve a fixed fraction of the backbone as well. And
then we presented a backbone guided local search (BGLS) with Walksat operator
for weighted MAX-SAT. BGLS consists of two phases: the first phase samples the
backbone information from local optima and the backbone phase conducts local
search under the guideline of backbone. Extensive experimental results on the
benchmark showed that BGLS outperforms the existing heuristics in both solution
quality and runtime.

two-dimensional (2d) semiconductors for optoelectronic and flexible devices.
However, a microscopic explanation of their photophysics -- of pivotal
importance for the understanding and optimization of device operation -- is
still lacking. Here we use femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, with
pump pulse tunability and broadband probing, to monitor the relaxation dynamics
of single-layer MoS2 over the entire visible range, upon photoexcitation of
different excitonic transitions. We find that, irrespective of excitation
photon energy, the transient absorption spectrum shows the simultaneous
bleaching of all excitonic transitions and corresponding red-shifted
photoinduced absorption bands. First-principle modeling of the ultrafast
optical response reveals that a transient bandgap renormalization, caused by
the presence of photo-excited carriers, is primarily responsible for the
observed features. Our results demonstrate the strong impact of many-body
effects in the transient optical response of TMDs even in the
low-excitation-density regime.

"In the context of observational studies, how can we quantify the potential impact of unmeasured confounders on the estimation of treatment effects?",f4beb3f7,"Title: Sensitivity analysis for inverse probability weighting estimators via the percentile bootstrap

        Abstract:   To identify the estimand in missing data problems and observational studies,
it is common to base the statistical estimation on the ""missing at random"" and
""no unmeasured confounder"" assumptions. However, these assumptions are
unverifiable using empirical data and pose serious threats to the validity of
the qualitative conclusions of the statistical inference. A sensitivity
analysis asks how the conclusions may change if the unverifiable assumptions
are violated to a certain degree. In this paper we consider a marginal
sensitivity model which is a natural extension of Rosenbaum's sensitivity model
that is widely used for matched observational studies. We aim to construct
confidence intervals based on inverse probability weighting estimators, such
that asymptotically the intervals have at least nominal coverage of the
estimand whenever the data generating distribution is in the collection of
marginal sensitivity models. We use a percentile bootstrap and a generalized
minimax/maximin inequality to transform this intractable problem to a linear
fractional programming problem, which can be solved very efficiently. We
illustrate our method using a real dataset to estimate the causal effect of
fish consumption on blood mercury level.

""...a sensitivity analysis asks how the conclusions may change if the unverifiable assumptions are violated to a certain degree.""

They focus on constructing confidence intervals based on inverse probability weighting estimators, which would have at least nominal coverage of the estimand whenever the data generating distribution is in the collection of marginal sensitivity models. This approach would allow researchers to understand the potential impact of unmeasured confounders on their results.

""Conventional approaches do not constitute unbiased or consistent estimators of causal moderation effects.""

and data acquisition. However, digital signage can be one of the promising
technologies in this era of technology that is progressing toward the
interactive world, connecting users to the IoT network through device-to-device
communication technology. This article illustrates a novel prototype that is
mainly focused on a smart digital signage system comprised of software-defined
IoT (SD-IoT) and invisible image sensor communication technology. We have
proposed an SDN scheme with a view to initiating its flexibility and
compatibility for an IoT network-based smart digital signage system. The idea
of invisible communication can make the users of the technology trendier to it,
and the usage of unused resources such as images and videos can be ensured. In
addition, this communication has paved the way for interactivity between the
user and digital signage, where the digital signage and the camera of a
smartphone can be operated as a transmitter and a receiver, respectively. The
proposed scheme might be applicable to real-world applications because SDN has
the flexibility to adapt with the alteration of network status without any
hardware modifications while displays and smartphones are available everywhere.
A performance analysis of this system showed the advantages of an SD-IoT
network over an Internet protocol-based IoT network considering a queuing
analysis for a dynamic link allocation process in the case of user access to

execution of small step shift and rotation operations upon selected
discriminative hyperplanes at the arrival of input samples. When applied, in
conjunction with a selected feature extractor, to a subset of the ImageNet

What is the role of the capped-$ell_{2}$ norm in improving the robustness of contextual bandit methods?,06420b80,"Title: Robust Contextual Bandit via the Capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm

        Abstract:   This paper considers the actor-critic contextual bandit for the mobile health
(mHealth) intervention. The state-of-the-art decision-making methods in mHealth
generally assume that the noise in the dynamic system follows the Gaussian
distribution. Those methods use the least-square-based algorithm to estimate
the expected reward, which is prone to the existence of outliers. To deal with
the issue of outliers, we propose a novel robust actor-critic contextual bandit
method for the mHealth intervention. In the critic updating, the
capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm is used to measure the approximation error, which
prevents outliers from dominating our objective. A set of weights could be
achieved from the critic updating. Considering them gives a weighted objective
for the actor updating. It provides the badly noised sample in the critic
updating with zero weights for the actor updating. As a result, the robustness
of both actor-critic updating is enhanced. There is a key parameter in the
capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm. We provide a reliable method to properly set it by
making use of one of the most fundamental definitions of outliers in
statistics. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method can
achieve almost identical results compared with the state-of-the-art methods on
the dataset without outliers and dramatically outperform them on the datasets
noised by outliers.

Abstract: In the paper ""Robust Contextual Bandit via the Capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm"", the capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm is used to measure the approximation error in the critic updating process. This norm is chosen to prevent outliers from dominating the objective function. The capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the elements of a vector, but with a cap on the magnitude of each element. This helps to reduce the effect of extreme and potentially erroneous data points on the estimation of the expected reward. The capped-$\ell_{2}$ norm is used to achieve a set of weights, which are then used to weight the objective function for the actor updating process. This ensures that the badly noised sample in the critic updating process is given zero weights for the actor updating process, enhancing the robustness of both the actor and critic updating processes.",0.8599796
What are the conditions for a subsampling estimator to produce a normal limit that matches the target of block bootstrap estimation?,ac24635f,"Title: Convolved subsampling estimation with applications to block bootstrap

        Abstract:   The block bootstrap approximates sampling distributions from dependent data
by resampling data blocks. A fundamental problem is establishing its
consistency for the distribution of a sample mean, as a prototypical statistic.
We use a structural relationship with subsampling to characterize the bootstrap
in a new and general manner. While subsampling and block bootstrap differ, the
block bootstrap distribution of a sample mean equals that of a $k$-fold
self-convolution of a subsampling distribution. Motivated by this, we provide
simple necessary and sufficient conditions for a convolved subsampling
estimator to produce a normal limit that matches the target of bootstrap
estimation. These conditions may be linked to consistency properties of an
original subsampling distribution, which are often obtainable under minimal
assumptions. Through several examples, the results are shown to validate the
block bootstrap for means under significantly weakened assumptions in many
existing (and some new) dependence settings, which also addresses a standing
conjecture of Politis, Romano and Wolf(1999). Beyond sample means, the
convolved subsampling estimator may not match the block bootstrap, but instead
provides a hybrid-resampling estimator of interest in its own right. For
general statistics with normal limits, results also establish the consistency
of convolved subsampling under minimal dependence conditions, including
non-stationarity.

unverifiable using empirical data and pose serious threats to the validity of
the qualitative conclusions of the statistical inference. A sensitivity

What are effective outflow/open boundary conditions for simulating multiphase flows of N immiscible incompressible fluids?,3c553cbc,"Title: Multiphase Flows of N Immiscible Incompressible Fluids: An Outflow/Open Boundary Condition and Algorithm

associated algorithm for simulating the dynamics of multiphase flows consisting
of $N$ ($N\geqslant 2$) immiscible incompressible fluids in domains involving
outflows or open boundaries. These boundary conditions are devised based on the
properties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability
property ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the
energy balance will not cause the total energy of the N-phase system to
increase over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary conditions are very
effective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems. The
reduction consistency property ensures that if some fluid components are absent
from the N-phase system then these N-phase boundary conditions will reduce to
those corresponding boundary conditions for the equivalent smaller system. Our
numerical algorithm for the proposed boundary conditions together with the
N-phase governing equations involves only the solution of a set of de-coupled
individual Helmholtz-type equations within each time step, and the resultant
linear algebraic systems after discretization involve only constant and
time-independent coefficient matrices which can be pre-computed. Therefore, the
algorithm is computationally very efficient and attractive. We present
extensive numerical experiments for flow problems involving multiple fluid
components and inflow/outflow boundaries to test the proposed method. In

power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbation and express the spectral
tilt and running in terms of the slow-varying parameters. We show that
hyperinflation with power-law type potentials has already been excluded by the
recent Planck observations, while exponential-type potential with the exponent
of order unity can be made consistent with observations as far as the power
spectrum is concerned. We also argue that, in the context of a simple $D$-brane
inflation, the hyperinflation requires exponentially large hyperbolic extra
dimensions but that masses of Kaluza-Klein gravitons can be kept relatively
heavy.

"In the field of Visual Question Answering (VQA), what strategies have researchers explored to help humans better understand AI models?",65ae0dac,"Title: It Takes Two to Tango: Towards Theory of AI's Mind

        Abstract:   Theory of Mind is the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, intents,
knowledge, perspectives, etc.) to others and recognize that these mental states
may differ from one's own. Theory of Mind is critical to effective
communication and to teams demonstrating higher collective performance. To
effectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make our
lives more productive, it is important for humans and AI to work well together
in a team. Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to make AI
more accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it better understand human
intentions, tendencies, beliefs, and contexts. The latter involves making AI
more human-like and having it develop a theory of our minds. In this work, we
argue that for human-AI teams to be effective, humans must also develop a
theory of AI's mind (ToAIM) - get to know its strengths, weaknesses, beliefs,
and quirks. We instantiate these ideas within the domain of Visual Question
Answering (VQA). We find that using just a few examples (50), lay people can be
trained to better predict responses and oncoming failures of a complex VQA
model. We further evaluate the role existing explanation (or interpretability)
modalities play in helping humans build ToAIM. Explainable AI has received
considerable scientific and popular attention in recent times. Surprisingly, we
find that having access to the model's internal states - its confidence in its
top-k predictions, explicit or implicit attention maps which highlight regions
in the image (and words in the question) the model is looking at (and listening
to) while answering a question about an image - do not help people better
predict its behavior.

What is meant by the term 'soundness' in the context of SEA's analysis of self-modifying programs?,5fb26bb5,"Title: SEA: String Executability Analysis by Abstract Interpretation

        Abstract:   Dynamic languages often employ reflection primitives to turn dynamically
generated text into executable code at run-time. These features make standard
static analysis extremely hard if not impossible because its essential data
structures, i.e., the control-flow graph and the system of recursive equations
associated with the program to analyse, are themselves dynamically mutating
objects. We introduce SEA, an abstract interpreter for automatic sound string
executability analysis of dynamic languages employing bounded (i.e, finitely
nested) reflection and dynamic code generation. Strings are statically
approximated in an abstract domain of finite state automata with basic
operations implemented as symbolic transducers. SEA combines standard program
analysis together with string executability analysis. The analysis of a call to
reflection determines a call to the same abstract interpreter over a code which
is synthesised directly from the result of the static string executability
analysis at that program point. The use of regular languages for approximating
dynamically generated code structures allows SEA to soundly approximate safety
properties of self modifying programs yet maintaining efficiency. Soundness
here means that the semantics of the code synthesised by the analyser to
resolve reflection over-approximates the semantics of the code dynamically
built at run-rime by the program at that point.

these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and
human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that
ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather
than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and
reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate
that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based

instead when trained on ""Stylized-ImageNet"", a stylized version of ImageNet.
This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our

Title: Refracting Metasurfaces without Spurious Diffraction

Abstract: Refraction represents one of the most fundamental operations that may be performed by a metasurface. However, simple phasegradient metasurface designs suffer from restricted angular deflection due to spurious diffraction orders. It has been recently shown, using a circuit-based approach, that refraction without spurious diffraction, or diffraction-free, can fortunately be achieved by a transverse metasurface exhibiting either loss-gain or bianisotropy. Here, we rederive these conditions using a medium-based - and hence more insightful - approach based on Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) and surface susceptibility tensors...

Ah-ha! It looks like the paper indeed relates GSTCs to refraction in metasurfaces! According to the abstract, the paper uses GSTCs and surface susceptibility tensors to rederive the conditions for achieving diffraction-free refraction in metasurfaces. This means that GSTCs play a crucial role in understanding and designing metasurfaces that can refract light without producing unwanted diffraction patterns.",0.9458121

Abstract: In the past decade, the information security and threat landscape has grown significantly making it difficult for a single defender to defend against all attacks at the same time. This called for introducing information sharing, a paradigm in which threat indicators are shared in a community of trust to facilitate defenses. Standards for representation, exchange, and consumption of indicators are proposed in the literature, although various issues are undermined. In this paper, we rethink information sharing for actionable intelligence, by highlighting various issues that deserve further exploration. We argue that information sharing can benefit from well-defined use models, threat models, well-understood risk by measurement and robust scoring, well-understood and preserved privacy and quality of indicators, and robust mechanisms to avoid free riding behavior of selfish agents.

This paper highlights the need for robust scoring and risk measurement in information sharing, and identifies several key factors to consider:

1. Well-defined use models: Clearly understanding the intended use cases and objectives of information sharing can help ensure that the shared information is relevant and useful.
2. Threat models: Defining and understanding the types of threats that may be encountered can help inform the development of effective sharing strategies.
3. Well-understood risk by measurement: Accurate measurement and understanding of risk can help inform decision-making and ensure that the shared information is reliable and trustworthy.
4. Robust scoring: Establishing robust scoring mechanisms can help ensure that the shared information is effective in achieving the intended goals.
5. Well-understood and preserved privacy and quality of indicators: Ensuring that the shared information is protected and maintained at a high quality can help build trust and confidence in the sharing process.
6. Robust mechanisms to avoid free riding behavior of selfish agents: Implementing mechanisms to prevent selfish agents from exploiting the sharing process can help ensure that the shared information is used for the greater good.

These factors can help ensure that information sharing is effective and reliable, and that the shared information is used to achieve the intended goals.",0.6118001
What is a generalization of Valiant's load balancing scheme for packet-switched networks applied to arbitrary graphs?,d5423c14,"Title: Oblivious Routing via Random Walks

        Abstract:   We present novel oblivious routing algorithms for both splittable and

algorithm for this setting. As an intermediate step towards this algorithm, we
present a novel generalization of Valiant's classical load balancing scheme for

Our algorithm for minimizing congestion for \emph{splittable} multicommodity
flow improves upon the state-of-the-art, in terms of both running time and
performance, for graphs that exhibit good expansion guarantees. Our algorithms
rely on diffusing traffic via iterative applications of the random walk
operator. Consequently, the performance guarantees of our algorithms are
derived from the convergence of the random walk operator to the stationary
distribution and are expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the graph (which
dominates the mixing time).

Can light be used to experimentally demonstrate 4-dimensional topological pumping?,c01e95e9,"Title: Photonic topological pumping through the edges of a dynamical four-dimensional quantum Hall system

        Abstract:   When a two-dimensional electron gas is exposed to a perpendicular magnetic
field and an in-plane electric field, its conductance becomes quantized in the
transverse in-plane direction: this is known as the quantum Hall (QH) effect.
This effect is a result of the nontrivial topology of the system's electronic
band structure, where an integer topological invariant known as the first Chern
number leads to the quantization of the Hall conductance. Interestingly, it was
shown that the QH effect can be generalized mathematically to four spatial
dimensions (4D), but this effect has never been realized for the obvious reason
that experimental systems are bound to three spatial dimensions. In this work,
we harness the high tunability and control offered by photonic waveguide arrays
to experimentally realize a dynamically-generated 4D QH system using a 2D array
of coupled optical waveguides. The inter-waveguide separation is constructed
such that the propagation of light along the device samples over
higher-dimensional momenta in the directions orthogonal to the two physical
dimensions, thus realizing a 2D topological pump. As a result, the device's
band structure is associated with 4D topological invariants known as second
Chern numbers which support a quantized bulk Hall response with a 4D symmetry.
In a finite-sized system, the 4D topological bulk response is carried by
localized edges modes that cross the sample as a function of of the modulated
auxiliary momenta. We directly observe this crossing through photon pumping
from edge-to-edge and corner-to-corner of our system. These are equivalent to
the pumping of charge across a 4D system from one 3D hypersurface to the
opposite one and from one 2D hyperedge to another, and serve as first
experimental realization of higher-dimensional topological physics.

However, this is at odds with efficient use of NDP, which requires careful
placement of data in memory modules such that near-data computations and their
exclusively used data can be localized in individual memory modules, while
distributing shared data among memory modules to reduce hotspots. In order to
address this new challenge, we propose a set of techniques that (1) enable
collections of OS pages to either be fine-grain interleaved among memory
modules (as is done today) or to be placed contiguously on individual memory
modules (as is desirable for NDP private data), and (2) decide whether to
localize or distribute each memory object based on its anticipated access
pattern and steer computations to the memory where the data they access is
located. Our evaluations across a wide range of workloads show that the
proposed mechanism improves performance by 31% and reduces 38% remote data
accesses over a baseline system that cannot exploit computate-data affinity
characteristics.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that near-data processing (NDP) is an effective technique for improving performance and energy efficiency of data-intensive workloads. However, leveraging NDP in realistic systems with multiple memory modules introduces a new challenge. In today's systems, where no computation occurs in memory modules, the physical address space is interleaved at a fine granularity among all memory modules to help improve the utilization of processor-memory interfaces by distributing the memory traffic. However, this is at odds with efficient use of NDP, which requires careful placement of data in memory modules such that near-data computations and their exclusively used data can be localized in individual memory modules, while distributing shared data among memory modules to reduce hotspots.",0.95529115
What specific problem in the paper manufacturing industry does this research aim to address?,69aa7190,"Title: A novel distribution-free hybrid regression model for manufacturing process efficiency improvement

        Abstract:   This work is motivated by a particular problem of a modern paper
manufacturing industry, in which maximum efficiency of the fiber-filler
recovery process is desired. A lot of unwanted materials along with valuable
fibers and fillers come out as a by-product of the paper manufacturing process
and mostly goes as waste. The job of an efficient Krofta supracell is to
separate the unwanted materials from the valuable ones so that fibers and
fillers can be collected from the waste materials and reused in the
manufacturing process. The efficiency of Krofta depends on several crucial
process parameters and monitoring them is a difficult proposition. To solve
this problem, we propose a novel hybridization of regression trees (RT) and
artificial neural networks (ANN), hybrid RT-ANN model, to solve the problem of
low recovery percentage of the supracell. This model is used to achieve the
goal of improving supracell efficiency, viz., gain in percentage recovery. In
addition, theoretical results for the universal consistency of the proposed
model are given with the optimal value of a vital model parameter. Experimental
findings show that the proposed hybrid RT-ANN model achieves higher accuracy in
predicting Krofta recovery percentage than other conventional regression models
for solving the Krofta efficiency problem. This work will help the paper

ecological damage and improved waste recovery.

What methods have been proposed to mitigate the State Space Explosion problem?,ed0d10f4,"Title: Handling state space explosion in verification of component-based systems: A review

        Abstract:   Component-based design is a different way of constructing systems which

error-prone task. Model checking is one of the reliable methods that
automatically and systematically analyse the correctness of a given system. Its

appropriate methods to reduce SSE, is required. In two last decades, a great

How does the minimizing general loss viewpoint connect the objectives of the discriminator and generator in GANs?,b00d6f02,"Title: KGAN: How to Break The Minimax Game in GAN

        Abstract:   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were intuitively and attractively
explained under the perspective of game theory, wherein two involving parties
are a discriminator and a generator. In this game, the task of the
discriminator is to discriminate the real and generated (i.e., fake) data,
whilst the task of the generator is to generate the fake data that maximally
confuses the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a new viewpoint for GANs,
which is termed as the minimizing general loss viewpoint. This viewpoint shows
a connection between the general loss of a classification problem regarding a
convex loss function and a f-divergence between the true and fake data
distributions. Mathematically, we proposed a setting for the classification
problem of the true and fake data, wherein we can prove that the general loss
of this classification problem is exactly the negative f-divergence for a
certain convex function f. This allows us to interpret the problem of learning
the generator for dismissing the f-divergence between the true and fake data
distributions as that of maximizing the general loss which is equivalent to the
min-max problem in GAN if the Logistic loss is used in the classification
problem. However, this viewpoint strengthens GANs in two ways. First, it allows
us to employ any convex loss function for the discriminator. Second, it
suggests that rather than limiting ourselves in NN-based discriminators, we can
alternatively utilize other powerful families. Bearing this viewpoint, we then
propose using the kernel-based family for discriminators. This family has two
appealing features: i) a powerful capacity in classifying non-linear nature
data and ii) being convex in the feature space. Using the convexity of this
family, we can further develop Fenchel duality to equivalently transform the
max-min problem to the max-max dual problem.

Recently, there have been efforts to increase the functionality of MPI via

differences in the harmonic responses of the nanoparticles. In this work, we

What is the role of receptive field location estimation in  CNN-based system identification?,5c004e5f,"Title: Neural system identification for large populations separating ""what"" and ""where""

        Abstract:   Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar
computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods
for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what'
and 'where'. Learning deep convolutional feature spaces that are shared among
many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design
needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable
recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one
can sample only a small fraction of each neuron's response space. Here, we show
that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a
problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN
architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and
feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and
short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture
on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based
system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms
current state-of-the art system identification models of mouse primary visual
cortex.

up to a few tens of Hz for vibrations generated by human activities, cause a
large amount of damage, or inconvenience, depending on the geological
conditions they can travel considerable distances and may match the resonant
fundamental frequency of buildings. The ultimate aim of any seismic

Can non-Gaussian (but light-tailed) shocks lead to Pareto tails in economic size distributions?,79a5bc97,"Title: Geometrically stopped Markovian random growth processes and Pareto tails

        Abstract:   Many empirical studies document power law behavior in size distributions of
economic interest such as cities, firms, income, and wealth. One mechanism for
generating such behavior combines independent and identically distributed
Gaussian additive shocks to log-size with a geometric age distribution. We
generalize this mechanism by allowing the shocks to be non-Gaussian (but
light-tailed) and dependent upon a Markov state variable. Our main results
provide sharp bounds on tail probabilities and simple formulas for Pareto
exponents. We present two applications: (i) we show that the tails of the
wealth distribution in a heterogeneous-agent dynamic general equilibrium model
with idiosyncratic endowment risk decay exponentially, unlike models with
investment risk where the tails may be Paretian, and (ii) we show that a random
growth model for the population dynamics of Japanese prefectures is consistent
with the observed Pareto exponent but only after allowing for Markovian
dynamics.

music tracks based on album information are inefficient. Moreover, they
demonstrated that people use emotion tags for music tracks in order to search
and retrieve them. In this paper, we discuss separability of a set of emotional

separation theorem. We determine a set of adjectives to tag music parts: happy,
sad, relaxing, exciting, epic and thriller. Temporal, frequency and energy
features have been extracted from the music parts. It could be seen that the
maximum separability within the extracted features occurs between relaxing and
epic music parts. Finally, we have trained a classifier using Support Vector
Machines to automatically recognize and generate emotional labels for a music

results show that epic music can be recognized more accurately (77.4%),

Can a simple empirical estimator be used to achieve optimal sample complexity for identity testing in certain cases? ,7fc98418,"Title: Optimal Identity Testing with High Probability

        Abstract:   We study the problem of testing identity against a given distribution with a
focus on the high confidence regime. More precisely, given samples from an
unknown distribution $p$ over $n$ elements, an explicitly given distribution
$q$, and parameters $0< \epsilon, \delta < 1$, we wish to distinguish, {\em
with probability at least $1-\delta$}, whether the distributions are identical
versus $\varepsilon$-far in total variation distance. Most prior work focused
on the case that $\delta = \Omega(1)$, for which the sample complexity of
identity testing is known to be $\Theta(\sqrt{n}/\epsilon^2)$. Given such an
algorithm, one can achieve arbitrarily small values of $\delta$ via black-box
amplification, which multiplies the required number of samples by
$\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$.
We show that black-box amplification is suboptimal for any $\delta = o(1)$,
and give a new identity tester that achieves the optimal sample complexity. Our
new upper and lower bounds show that the optimal sample complexity of identity
testing is \[
\Theta\left( \frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\left(\sqrt{n \log(1/\delta)} +
\log(1/\delta) \right)\right) \] for any $n, \varepsilon$, and $\delta$. For
the special case of uniformity testing, where the given distribution is the
uniform distribution $U_n$ over the domain, our new tester is surprisingly
simple: to test whether $p = U_n$ versus $d_{\mathrm TV}(p, U_n) \geq
\varepsilon$, we simply threshold $d_{\mathrm TV}(\widehat{p}, U_n)$, where
$\widehat{p}$ is the empirical probability distribution. The fact that this
simple ""plug-in"" estimator is sample-optimal is surprising, even in the
constant $\delta$ case. Indeed, it was believed that such a tester would not
attain sublinear sample complexity even for constant values of $\varepsilon$

How is the 'noise' or inefficiency of a representation in deep learning related to the entropy of state frequencies?,c2deb041,"Title: Resolution and Relevance Trade-offs in Deep Learning

        Abstract:   Deep learning has been successfully applied to various tasks, but its
underlying mechanism remains unclear. Neural networks associate similar inputs
in the visible layer to the same state of hidden variables in deep layers. The
fraction of inputs that are associated to the same state is a natural measure
of similarity and is simply related to the cost in bits required to represent
these inputs. The degeneracy of states with the same information cost provides
instead a natural measure of noise and is simply related the entropy of the
frequency of states, that we call relevance. Representations with minimal
noise, at a given level of similarity (resolution), are those that maximise the
relevance. A signature of such efficient representations is that frequency
distributions follow power laws. We show, in extensive numerical experiments,
that deep neural networks extract a hierarchy of efficient representations from
data, because they i) achieve low levels of noise (i.e. high relevance) and ii)
exhibit power law distributions. We also find that the layer that is most
efficient to reliably generate patterns of training data is the one for which
relevance and resolution are traded at the same price, which implies that
frequency distribution follows Zipf's law.

How can we design a compact and effective network without massive experiments

scale the outputs of specific structures, such as neurons, groups or residual
blocks. Then we add sparsity regularizations on these factors, and solve this
optimization problem by a modified stochastic Accelerated Proximal Gradient
(APG) method. By forcing some of the factors to zero, we can safely remove the
corresponding structures, thus prune the unimportant parts of a CNN. Comparing

This paper presents a method that combines attention-based guided structured sparsity with supervised network pruning to control the sparsity intensity and ensure the preservation of important information bottlenecks.

What mathematical technique is introduced to address the challenge of calculating Delta in the context of stochastic functional differential equations?,8bcc0599,"Title: Stochastic functional differential equations and sensitivity to their initial path

        Abstract:   We consider systems with memory represented by stochastic functional
differential equations. Substantially, these are stochastic differential
equations with coefficients depending on the past history of the process
itself. Such coefficients are hence defined on a functional space. Models with
memory appear in many applications ranging from biology to finance. Here we
consider the results of some evaluations based on these models (e.g. the prices
of some financial products) and the risks connected to the choice of these
models. In particular we focus on the impact of the initial condition on the
evaluations. This problem is known as the analysis of sensitivity to the
initial condition and, in the terminology of finance, it is referred to as the
Delta. In this work the initial condition is represented by the relevant past
history of the stochastic functional differential equation. This naturally
leads to the redesign of the definition of Delta. We suggest to define it as a
functional directional derivative, this is a natural choice. For this we study
a representation formula which allows for its computation without requiring
that the evaluation functional is differentiable. This feature is particularly
relevant for applications. Our formula is achieved by studying an appropriate

What conditions on inclusion probabilities ensure consistency of the joint posterior in Bayesian estimation under informative sampling?,dc837bc0,"Title: Fully Bayesian Estimation Under Informative Sampling

        Abstract:   Bayesian estimation is increasingly popular for performing model based
inference to support policymaking. These data are often collected from surveys
under informative sampling designs where subject inclusion probabilities are
designed to be correlated with the response variable of interest. Sampling
weights constructed from marginal inclusion probabilities are typically used to
form an exponentiated pseudo likelihood that adjusts the population likelihood
for estimation on the sample due to ease-of-estimation. We propose an
alternative adjustment based on a Bayes rule construction that simultaneously
performs weight smoothing and estimates the population model parameters in a
fully Bayesian construction. We formulate conditions on known marginal and
pairwise inclusion probabilities that define a class of sampling designs where
$L_{1}$ consistency of the joint posterior is guaranteed. We compare
performances between the two approaches on synthetic data, which reveals that
our fully Bayesian approach better estimates posterior uncertainty without a
requirement to calibrate the normalization of the sampling weights. We
demonstrate our method on an application concerning the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey exploring the relationship between caffeine

Title: Latent Geometry and Memorization in Generative Models

Abstract: It can be difficult to tell whether a trained generative model has learned to generate novel examples or has simply memorized a specific set of outputs. In published work, it is common to attempt to address this visually, for example by displaying a generated example and its nearest neighbor(s) in the training set (in, for example, the L2 metric). As any generative model induces a probability density on its output domain, we propose studying this density directly. We first study the geometry of the latent representation and generator, relate this to the output density, and then develop techniques to compute and inspect the output density. As an application, we demonstrate that ""memorization"" tends to a density made of delta functions concentrated on the memorized examples. We note that without first understanding the geometry, the measurement would be essentially impossible to make.

How can predictive models be used to analyze neuroimaging data at a subject-specific level?,00ecc542,"Title: Reconstructing Subject-Specific Effect Maps

        Abstract:   Predictive models allow subject-specific inference when analyzing disease
related alterations in neuroimaging data. Given a subject's data, inference can
be made at two levels: global, i.e. identifiying condition presence for the
subject, and local, i.e. detecting condition effect on each individual
measurement extracted from the subject's data. While global inference is widely
used, local inference, which can be used to form subject-specific effect maps,
is rarely used because existing models often yield noisy detections composed of
dispersed isolated islands. In this article, we propose a reconstruction
method, named RSM, to improve subject-specific detections of predictive
modeling approaches and in particular, binary classifiers. RSM specifically
aims to reduce noise due to sampling error associated with using a finite
sample of examples to train classifiers. The proposed method is a wrapper-type
algorithm that can be used with different binary classifiers in a diagnostic
manner, i.e. without information on condition presence. Reconstruction is posed
as a Maximum-A-Posteriori problem with a prior model whose parameters are
estimated from training data in a classifier-specific fashion. Experimental
evaluation is performed on synthetically generated data and data from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Results on
synthetic data demonstrate that using RSM yields higher detection accuracy
compared to using models directly or with bootstrap averaging. Analyses on the
ADNI dataset show that RSM can also improve correlation between
subject-specific detections in cortical thickness data and non-imaging markers
of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), such as the Mini Mental State Examination Score
and Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-$\beta$ levels. Further reliability studies on
the longitudinal ADNI dataset show improvement on detection reliability when
RSM is used.

What is stigmergy and how can it be applied to identifying high density areas in a city?,30533fe4,"Title: Stigmergy-based modeling to discover urban activity patterns from positioning data

        Abstract:   Positioning data offer a remarkable source of information to analyze crowds
urban dynamics. However, discovering urban activity patterns from the emergent
behavior of crowds involves complex system modeling. An alternative approach is
to adopt computational techniques belonging to the emergent paradigm, which
enables self-organization of data and allows adaptive analysis. Specifically,
our approach is based on stigmergy. By using stigmergy each sample position is
associated with a digital pheromone deposit, which progressively evaporates and
aggregates with other deposits according to their spatiotemporal proximity.
Based on this principle, we exploit positioning data to identify high density
areas (hotspots) and characterize their activity over time. This
characterization allows the comparison of dynamics occurring in different days,
providing a similarity measure exploitable by clustering techniques. Thus, we
cluster days according to their activity behavior, discovering unexpected urban
activity patterns. As a case study, we analyze taxi traces in New York City
during 2015.

Title: On A Conjecture Regarding Permutations Which Destroy Arithmetic Progressions

Abstract: Hegarty conjectured for $n\neq 2, 3, 5, 7$ that $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ has a permutation which destroys all arithmetic progressions mod $n$. For $n\ge n_0$, Hegarty and Martinsson demonstrated that $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ has an arithmetic-progression destroying permutation. However, $n_0\approx 1.4\times 10^{14}$ and thus resolving the conjecture in full remained out of reach of any computational techniques. However, this paper using constructions modeled after those used by Elkies and Swaminathan for the case of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ with $p$ being prime, establish the conjecture in full. Furthermore, our results do not rely on the fact that it suffices to study when $n<n_0$ and thus our results completely independent of the proof given by Hegarty and Martinsson.

mimic a distributed storage of a set of $n$ data items on $m$ servers, in such
a way that any batch of $k$ data items can be retrieved by reading at most some
$t$ symbols from each server. Combinatorial batch codes, are replication-based
batch codes in which each server stores a subset of the data items.
In this paper, we propose a generalization of combinatorial batch codes,
called multiset combinatorial batch codes (MCBC), in which $n$ data items are
stored in $m$ servers, such that any multiset request of $k$ items, where any
item is requested at most $r$ times, can be retrieved by reading at most $t$
items from each server. The setup of this new family of codes is motivated by
recent work on codes which enable high availability and parallel reads in
distributed storage systems. The main problem under this paradigm is to
minimize the number of items stored in the servers, given the values of
$n,m,k,r,t$, which is denoted by $N(n,k,m,t;r)$. We first give a necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of MCBCs. Then, we present several

This is based on the fact that a fully connected feedforward network with one
hidden layer, a certain weight distribution, an activation function, and an
infinite number of neurons can be viewed as a mapping into a Hilbert space. We
derive the equivalent kernels of MLPs with ReLU or Leaky ReLU activations for
all rotationally-invariant weight distributions, generalizing a previous result
that required Gaussian weight distributions. Additionally, the Central Limit
Theorem is used to show that for certain activation functions, kernels
corresponding to layers with weight distributions having $0$ mean and finite
absolute third moment are asymptotically universal, and are well approximated
by the kernel corresponding to layers with spherical Gaussian weights. In deep
networks, as depth increases the equivalent kernel approaches a pathological
fixed point, which can be used to argue why training randomly initialized
networks can be difficult. Our results also have implications for weight
initialization.

Additionally, the Central Limit Theorem is used to show that for certain activation functions, kernels corresponding to layers with weight distributions having 0 mean and finite absolute third moment are asymptotically universal, and are well approximated by the kernel corresponding to layers with spherical Gaussian weights. In deep networks, as depth increases the equivalent kernel approaches a pathological fixed point, which can be used to argue why training randomly initialized networks can be difficult.

This paper discusses the concept of equivalent kernels and their relationship to weight distributions. They show that certain weight distributions can be approximated by spherical Gaussian weights, which may be useful for weight initialization.

Title: On the trade-off between labels and weights in quantitative bisimulation

Abstract: ... We prove that there is a trade-off between labels and weights: at one extreme lays the class of (unlabelled) weighted transition systems where information is presented using weights only; at the other lays the class of labelled transition systems (LTSs) where information is shifted on labels.

This paper doesn't seem to be directly related to weight initialization.

Title: Convergence Analysis of the Dynamics of a Special Kind of Two-Layered Neural Networks with $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ Regularization

Abstract: ... We proved that when $\lambda$ is small, the weight vector $w$ converges to the optimal solution $\hat{w}$ (with respect to the new loss function) with probability $\geq (1-\varepsilon)(1-A_d)/2$ under random initiations in a sphere centered at the origin, where $\varepsilon$ is a small value and $A_d$ is a constant. Numerical experiments including phase diagrams and repeated simulations verified our theory.

This paper discusses the convergence analysis of a specific type of neural network and includes a result about the convergence of the weight vector to the optimal solution for small values of $\lambda$. This might be indirectly related to weight initialization, but it's not clear how it could be directly applied.

I couldn't find any explicit results that inform strategies for weight initialization, but the papers I mentioned do discuss weight distributions, equivalent kernels, and the convergence of weight vectors.",0.79024875
Under what conditions does the gap between Laguerre's lower bound and the smallest eigenvalue become smallest?,6fcfed81,"Title: On the optimality and sharpness of Laguerre's lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite matrix

        Abstract:   Lower bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric positive definite
matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ play an important role in condition
number estimation and in iterative methods for singular value computation. In
particular, the bounds based on ${\rm Tr}(A^{-1})$ and ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})$
attract attention recently because they can be computed in $O(m)$ work when $A$
is tridiagonal. In this paper, we focus on these bounds and investigate their
properties in detail. First, we consider the problem of finding the optimal
bound that can be computed solely from ${\rm Tr}(A^{-1})$ and ${\rm
Tr}(A^{-2})$ and show that so called Laguerre's lower bound is the optimal one
in terms of sharpness. Next, we study the gap between the Laguerre bound and
the smallest eigenvalue. We characterize the situation in which the gap becomes
largest in terms of the eigenvalue distribution of $A$ and show that the gap
becomes smallest when ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})/\{{\rm Tr}(A^{-1})\}^2$ approaches 1 or
$\frac{1}{m}$. These results will be useful, for example, in designing
efficient shift strategies for singular value computation algorithms.
","Title: Smallest eigenvalue density for regular or fixed-trace complex Wishart-Laguerre ensemble and entanglement in coupled kicked tops

Abstract: The statistical behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue has important implications for systems which can be modeled using a Wishart-Laguerre ensemble, the regular one or the fixed trace one. For example, the density of the smallest eigenvalue of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble plays a crucial role in characterizing multiple channel telecommunication systems. Similarly, in the quantum entanglement problem, the smallest eigenvalue of the fixed trace ensemble carries information regarding the nature of entanglement. For real Wishart-Laguerre matrices, there exists an elegant recurrence scheme suggested by Edelman to directly obtain the exact expression for the smallest eigenvalue density. In the case of complex Wishart-Laguerre matrices, for finding exact and explicit expressions for the smallest eigenvalue density, existing results based on determinants become impractical when the determinants involve large-size matrices. In this work, we derive a recurrence scheme for the complex case which is analogous to that of Edelman's for the real case. This is used to obtain exact results for the smallest eigenvalue density for both the regular, and the fixed trace complex Wishart-Laguerre ensembles. We validate our analytical results using Monte Carlo simulations. We also study scaled Wishart-Laguerre ensemble and investigate its efficacy in approximating the fixed-trace ensemble. Eventually, we apply our result for the fixed-trace ensemble to investigate the behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue in the paradigmatic system of coupled kicked tops.

Under the condition that ${\rm Tr}(A^{-2})/\{{\rm Tr}(A^{-1})\}^2$ approaches 1 or $\frac{1}{m}$, the gap between Laguerre's lower bound and the smallest eigenvalue becomes smallest.",0.58464855

Title: Training Neural Networks Using Features Replay

Abstract: Training a neural network using backpropagation algorithm requires passing error gradients sequentially through the network. The backward locking prevents us from updating network layers in parallel and fully leveraging the computing resources. Recently, there are several works trying to decouple and parallelize the backpropagation algorithm. However, all of them suffer from severe accuracy loss or memory explosion when the neural network is deep. To address these challenging issues, we propose a novel parallel-objective formulation for the objective function of the neural network. After that, we introduce features replay algorithm and prove that it is guaranteed to converge to critical points for the non-convex problem under certain conditions. Finally, we apply our method to training deep convolutional neural networks, and the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves {faster} convergence, {lower} memory consumption, and {better} generalization error than compared methods.

This title and abstract suggest that the limitations of traditional backpropagation techniques for training generative models of sequential data include:

1. Sequential processing, which prevents parallelization and does not fully leverage computing resources.
2. Error gradients that may lock backward and prevent the simultaneous update of network layers.
3. The risk of severe accuracy loss or memory explosion when training deep neural networks.

The proposed features replay algorithm aims to address these limitations by introducing a parallel-objective formulation and proving convergence to critical points for the non-convex problem under certain conditions.",0.56979126

Recently, there have been efforts to increase the functionality of MPI via
multi-color imaging methods that can distinguish the responses of different
nanoparticles, or nanoparticles in different environmental conditions. The
proposed techniques typically rely on extensive calibrations that capture the
differences in the harmonic responses of the nanoparticles. In this work, we

adiabatic MPI signal when the same region is scanned back and forth. We

What is the estimated value of the Hubble constant obtained from the Bayesian hierarchical model when considering outlier-cleaned Riess et al. (2016) data?,ed3bbe2a,"Title: Clarifying the Hubble constant tension with a Bayesian hierarchical model of the local distance ladder

        Abstract:   Estimates of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, from the distance ladder and the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) differ at the $\sim$3-$\sigma$ level,
indicating a potential issue with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.
Interpreting this tension correctly requires a model comparison calculation
depending on not only the traditional `$n$-$\sigma$' mismatch but also the
tails of the likelihoods. Determining the form of the tails of the local $H_0$
likelihood is impossible with the standard Gaussian least-squares
approximation, as it requires using non-Gaussian distributions to faithfully
represent anchor likelihoods and model outliers in the Cepheid and supernova
(SN) populations, and simultaneous fitting of the full distance-ladder dataset
to correctly propagate uncertainties. We have developed a Bayesian hierarchical
model that describes the full distance ladder, from nearby geometric anchors
through Cepheids to Hubble-Flow SNe. This model does not rely on any
distributions being Gaussian, allowing outliers to be modeled and obviating the
need for arbitrary data cuts. Sampling from the $\sim$3000-parameter joint
posterior using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we find $H_0$ = (72.72 $\pm$ 1.67)

assess the evidence for deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. We set up this comparison
to yield a lower limit on the odds of the underlying model being $\Lambda$CDM
given the distance-ladder and Planck XIII (2016) CMB data. The odds against
$\Lambda$CDM are at worst 10:1 or 7:1, depending on whether the SNe outliers
are cut or modeled, or 60:1 if an approximation to the Planck Int. XLVI (2016)
likelihood is used.

Markovian-based and clustering-based approaches to learn motion primitives in a

the transition between learned primitives as a Gaussian Process (GP). This work
extends that prior approach by incorporating semantic features from the

lights) in the GP formulation for more accurate predictions of pedestrian
trajectories over the same timescale. We evaluate the new approach on

Demand fleet. The results show 12.5% improvement in prediction accuracy and a
2.65 times reduction in Area Under the Curve (AUC), which is used as a metric

$\delta > 1$, partitions $V$ into subsets $V_1, \ldots, V_h$ for some $h\geq
1$, such that
$\bullet$ at most $\delta^{-1}$ fraction of the weights are between clusters,
i.e. \[ w(E - \cup_{i = 1}^h E(V_i)) \lesssim \frac{w(E)}{\delta};\]
$\bullet$ the effective resistance diameter of each of the induced subgraphs

In particular, it is possible to remove one percent of weight of edges of any
given graph such that each of the resulting connected components has effective
resistance diameter at most the inverse of the average weighted degree.
Our proof is based on a new connection between effective resistance and low
conductance sets. We show that if the effective resistance between two vertices

from $v$. This implies that very mildly expanding graphs have constant

        Abstract:   This paper considers the problem of decentralized optimization with a
composite objective containing smooth and non-smooth terms. To solve the
problem, a proximal-gradient scheme is studied. Specifically, the smooth and
nonsmooth terms are dealt with by gradient update and proximal update,
respectively. The studied algorithm is closely related to a previous
decentralized optimization algorithm, PG-EXTRA [37], but has a few advantages.
First of all, in our new scheme, agents use uncoordinated step-sizes and the
stable upper bounds on step-sizes are independent from network topology. The
step-sizes depend on local objective functions, and they can be as large as
that of the gradient descent. Secondly, for the special case without non-smooth
terms, linear convergence can be achieved under the strong convexity
assumption. The dependence of the convergence rate on the objective functions
and the network are separated, and the convergence rate of our new scheme is as
good as one of the two convergence rates that match the typical rates for the
general gradient descent and the consensus averaging. We also provide some
numerical experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the introduced algorithms
and validate our theoretical discoveries.

What are the challenges of achieving perfect resource matching in cloud elasticity management? ,bacc490d,"Title: A Debt-Aware Learning Approach for Resource Adaptations in Cloud Elasticity Management

        Abstract:   Elasticity is a cloud property that enables applications and its execution
systems to dynamically acquire and release shared computational resources on
demand. Moreover, it unfolds the advantage of economies of scale in the cloud
through a drop in the average costs of these shared resources. However, it is
still an open challenge to achieve a perfect match between resource demand and
provision in autonomous elasticity management. Resource adaptation decisions
essentially involve a trade-off between economics and performance, which
produces a gap between the ideal and actual resource provisioning. This gap, if
not properly managed, can negatively impact the aggregate utility of a cloud
customer in the long run. To address this limitation, we propose a technical
debt-aware learning approach for autonomous elasticity management based on a
reinforcement learning of elasticity debts in resource provisioning; the
adaptation pursues strategic decisions that trades off economics against
performance. We extend CloudSim and Burlap to evaluate our approach. The
evaluation shows that a reinforcement learning of technical debts in elasticity
obtains a higher utility for a cloud customer, while conforming expected levels
of performance.

Our approach, Myopic Posterior Sampling (MPS), is inspired by the classical posterior (Thompson) sampling algorithm for multi-armed bandits and leverages the flexibility of probabilistic programming and approximate Bayesian inference to address a broad set of problems. Empirically, this general-purpose strategy is competitive with more specialized methods in a wide array of DOE tasks, and more importantly, enables addressing complex DOE goals where no existing method seems applicable. On the theoretical side, we leverage ideas from adaptive submodularity and reinforcement learning to derive conditions under which MPS achieves sublinear regret against natural benchmark policies.",0.9999315

How can  a closed machine learning system restrict an entity from inferring protected information?,7693e6f7,"Title: Learning to Succeed while Teaching to Fail: Privacy in Closed Machine Learning Systems

        Abstract:   Security, privacy, and fairness have become critical in the era of data
science and machine learning. More and more we see that achieving universally
secure, private, and fair systems is practically impossible. We have seen for
example how generative adversarial networks can be used to learn about the
expected private training data; how the exploitation of additional data can
reveal private information in the original one; and how what looks like
unrelated features can teach us about each other. Confronted with this
challenge, in this paper we open a new line of research, where the security,
privacy, and fairness is learned and used in a closed environment. The goal is
to ensure that a given entity (e.g., the company or the government), trusted to
infer certain information with our data, is blocked from inferring protected
information from it. For example, a hospital might be allowed to produce
diagnosis on the patient (the positive task), without being able to infer the
gender of the subject (negative task). Similarly, a company can guarantee that
internally it is not using the provided data for any undesired task, an
important goal that is not contradicting the virtually impossible challenge of
blocking everybody from the undesired task. We design a system that learns to
succeed on the positive task while simultaneously fail at the negative one, and
illustrate this with challenging cases where the positive task is actually
harder than the negative one being blocked. Fairness, to the information in the
negative task, is often automatically obtained as a result of this proposed
approach. The particular framework and examples open the door to security,
privacy, and fairness in very important closed scenarios, ranging from private
data accumulation companies like social networks to law-enforcement and
hospitals.

This approach, which they call a ""blocked private training data"" scenario, would allow a trusted entity (e.g., a hospital) to perform the desired task without being able to infer the protected information.

Can any convex loss function be used  when applying the minimizing general loss viewpoint to GANs?,b00d6f02,"Title: KGAN: How to Break The Minimax Game in GAN

        Abstract:   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were intuitively and attractively
explained under the perspective of game theory, wherein two involving parties
are a discriminator and a generator. In this game, the task of the
discriminator is to discriminate the real and generated (i.e., fake) data,
whilst the task of the generator is to generate the fake data that maximally
confuses the discriminator. In this paper, we propose a new viewpoint for GANs,
which is termed as the minimizing general loss viewpoint. This viewpoint shows
a connection between the general loss of a classification problem regarding a
convex loss function and a f-divergence between the true and fake data
distributions. Mathematically, we proposed a setting for the classification
problem of the true and fake data, wherein we can prove that the general loss
of this classification problem is exactly the negative f-divergence for a
certain convex function f. This allows us to interpret the problem of learning
the generator for dismissing the f-divergence between the true and fake data
distributions as that of maximizing the general loss which is equivalent to the
min-max problem in GAN if the Logistic loss is used in the classification
problem. However, this viewpoint strengthens GANs in two ways. First, it allows
us to employ any convex loss function for the discriminator. Second, it
suggests that rather than limiting ourselves in NN-based discriminators, we can
alternatively utilize other powerful families. Bearing this viewpoint, we then
propose using the kernel-based family for discriminators. This family has two
appealing features: i) a powerful capacity in classifying non-linear nature
data and ii) being convex in the feature space. Using the convexity of this
family, we can further develop Fenchel duality to equivalently transform the
max-min problem to the max-max dual problem.

Can passive cross-linkers enhance the efficiency of active motor proteins?,c3033e68,"Title: Stochastic Ratcheting on a Funneled Energy Landscape is Necessary for Highly Efficient Contractility of Actomyosin Force Dipoles

        Abstract:   Current understanding of how contractility emerges in disordered actomyosin
networks of non-muscle cells is still largely based on the intuition derived
from earlier works on muscle contractility. This view, however, largely
overlooks the free energy gain following passive cross-linker binding, which,
even in the absence of active fluctuations, provides a thermodynamic drive
towards highly overlapping filamentous states. In this work, we shed light on
this phenomenon, showing that passive cross-linkers, when considered in the
context of two anti-parallel filaments, generate noticeable contractile forces.
However, as binding free energy of cross-linkers is increased, a sharp onset of
kinetic arrest follows, greatly diminishing effectiveness of this contractility
mechanism, allowing the network to contract only with weakly resisting tensions
at its boundary. We have carried out stochastic simulations elucidating this
mechanism, followed by a mean-field treatment that predicts how contractile
forces asymptotically scale at small and large binding energies, respectively.
Furthermore, when considering an active contractile filament pair, based on
non-muscle myosin II, we found that the non-processive nature of these motors
leads to highly inefficient force generation, due to recoil slippage of the
overlap during periods when the motor is dissociated. However, we discovered
that passive cross-linkers can serve as a structural ratchet during these
unbound motor time spans, resulting in vast force amplification. Our results
shed light on the non-equilibrium effects of transiently binding proteins in
biological active matter, as observed in the non-muscle actin cytoskeleton,
showing that highly efficient contractile force dipoles result from synergy of
passive cross-linker and active motor dynamics, via a ratcheting mechanism on a
funneled energy landscape.

Title: Graph Theoretical Models of Closed n-Dimensional Manifolds: Digital Models of a Moebius Strip, a Torus, a Projective Plane, a Klein Bottle and n-Dimensional Spheres

Abstract: (full abstract provided earlier)

According to this paper, an LCL (Locally Connected Lattice) collection of n-cells in Euclidean space is introduced and investigated. It plays a crucial role in constructing these graph-theoretical models of closed n-dimensional manifolds. Specifically, if an LCL collection of n-cells is a cover of a continuous n-dimensional manifold, then the intersection graph of this cover is a digital closed n-dimensional manifold with the same topology as its continuous counterpart.

In other words, an LCL collection of n-cells serves as a foundation for converting a continuous n-dimensional manifold into a digital model that retains its topological properties. This digital model can then be used to analyze and manipulate the manifold in a more computationally tractable way.

How does biological computation differ from traditional computer science approaches?,50d0200a,"Title: Design of the Artificial: lessons from the biological roots of general intelligence

        Abstract:   Our desire and fascination with intelligent machines dates back to the
antiquity's mythical automaton Talos, Aristotle's mode of mechanical thought
(syllogism) and Heron of Alexandria's mechanical machines and automata.
However, the quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is troubled with
repeated failures of strategies and approaches throughout the history. This
decade has seen a shift in interest towards bio-inspired software and hardware,
with the assumption that such mimicry entails intelligence. Though these steps
are fruitful in certain directions and have advanced automation, their singular
design focus renders them highly inefficient in achieving AGI. Which set of
requirements have to be met in the design of AGI? What are the limits in the
design of the artificial? Here, a careful examination of computation in
biological systems hints that evolutionary tinkering of contextual processing
of information enabled by a hierarchical architecture is the key to build AGI.

Are there discrepancies between Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) measurements and direct imaging techniques like AFM when measuring the size of extracellular vesicles (EVs)?,1673853e,"Title: The effects of subdiffusion on the NTA size measurements of extracellular vesicles in biological samples

        Abstract:   The interest in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as they
became reliable biomarkers for many diseases. For this reason, fast and
accurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost
importance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their
diffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA
follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement
(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\propto t$). However, we show
that NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples,
i.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour
(MSD $\propto t^\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$). To support this observation we present
a range of experimental results for both polystyrene beads and EVs. This is
also related to another problem: for the same samples there exists a huge
discrepancy (by the factor of 2-4) between the sizes measured with NTA and with
the direct imaging methods, such as AFM. This can be remedied by e.g. the
Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is
limited in the biological and poly-disperse samples. On the other hand, the
models of sub-diffusion rarely provide the direct relation between the size of
a particle and the generalized diffusion constant. However, we solve this last
problem by introducing the logarithmic model of sub-diffusion, aimed at
retrieving the size data. In result, we propose a novel protocol of NTA data
analysis. The accuracy of our method is on par with FTLA for small
($\simeq$200nm) particles. We apply our method to study the EVs samples and
corroborate the results with AFM.

What are the difficulties in recognizing facial action units (AUs) specifically when coupled with speech?,23d32d82,"Title: Listen to Your Face: Inferring Facial Action Units from Audio Channel

        Abstract:   Extensive efforts have been devoted to recognizing facial action units (AUs).
However, it is still challenging to recognize AUs from spontaneous facial
displays especially when they are accompanied with speech. Different from all
prior work that utilized visual observations for facial AU recognition, this

correlated with voice during speech. Specifically, dynamic and physiological
relationships between AUs and phonemes are modeled through a continuous time
Bayesian network (CTBN); then AU recognition is performed by probabilistic
inference via the CTBN model.
A pilot audiovisual AU-coded database has been constructed to evaluate the

model reduction.
We develop here an algorithmic framework for constructing reduced models that
retains the linear time-periodic structure of the original LTP system. Our
approach generalizes optimal approaches that have been established previously
for linear time-invariant (LTI) model reduction problems. We employ an
extension of the usual H2 Hardy space defined for the LTI setting to

What are the geographical patterns of both pyriproxyfen use and microcephaly cases in Brazil? ,dbbd26d8,"Title: The Case for Pyriproxyfen as a Potential Cause for Microcephaly; From Biology to Epidemiology

        Abstract:   The Zika virus has been found in individual cases but has not been confirmed
as the cause of in the large number of cases of microcephaly in Brazil in
2015-6. Indeed, disparities between the incidence of Zika and microcephaly
across geographic locations has led to questions about the virus's role. Here
we consider whether the insecticide pyriproxyfen used in Brazilian drinking
water might be the primary cause or a cofactor. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile
hormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat
soluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin
A, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development
has been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone
analog approved as an insecticide in the 1970s has been shown to cause
developmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another retinoid causing
microcephaly via activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses.
We review tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo, which actually
found some evidence for this effect, including low brain mass and
arhinencephaly in exposed rat pups. Pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is
unprecedented, never having been applied to a water supply on a large scale.
Claims that its geographical pattern of use rule it out as a cause have not
been documented or confirmed. On the other hand, the very few microcephaly
cases reported in Colombia and the wide discrepancies of incidence in different
states across Brazil despite large numbers of Zika cases undermine the claim
that Zika is the cause. Given this combination of potential molecular
mechanism, toxicological and epidemiological evidence we strongly recommend
that the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal
link to microcephaly is investigated further.

topology and superconductivity coexist in both structural phases of MoC,
namely, the cubic $\alpha$ and hexagonal $\gamma$ phases. The $\alpha$ phase is
a strong topological insulator and the $\gamma$ phase is a topological nodal
line semimetal with drumhead surface states. In addition, hole doping can
stabilize the crystal structure of the $\alpha$ phase and elevate the
transition temperature in the $\gamma$ phase. Therefore, MoC in different
structural forms can be a practical material platform for studying topological
superconductivity and elusive Majorana fermions.

What is needed to effectively register multi-modal brain imaging data to a common reference atlas?,feee7fb7,"Title: Joint Atlas-Mapping of Multiple Histological Series combined with Multimodal MRI of Whole Marmoset Brains

organism for neuroscience research. To facilitate this development there is a
need for new computational tools to cross-register multi-modal data sets

Nissl, myelin, CTB, and fluorescent tracer images using a same-subject ex-vivo

and eliminates artifactual warping that may be result from the absence of a

tensor of the diffeomorphic mapping between each subject's ex-vivo MRI and

What is the range of weights considered in the algorithm's analysis,c2bf6ede,"Title: Concave Flow on Small Depth Directed Networks

        Abstract:   Small depth networks arise in a variety of network related applications,
often in the form of maximum flow and maximum weighted matching. Recent works
have generalized such methods to include costs arising from concave functions.
In this paper we give an algorithm that takes a depth $D$ network and strictly
increasing concave weight functions of flows on the edges and computes a $(1 -
\epsilon)$-approximation to the maximum weight flow in time $mD \epsilon^{-1}$
times an overhead that is logarithmic in the various numerical parameters
related to the magnitudes of gradients and capacities.
Our approach is based on extending the scaling algorithm for approximate
maximum weighted matchings by [Duan-Pettie JACM`14] to the setting of small
depth networks, and then generalizing it to concave functions. In this more
restricted setting of linear weights in the range $[w_{\min}, w_{\max}]$, it
produces a $(1 - \epsilon)$-approximation in time $O(mD \epsilon^{-1} \log(
w_{\max} /w_{\min}))$. The algorithm combines a variety of tools and provides a

Title: Speaker Diarization using Deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Speaker Embeddings

Abstract:   In this paper we propose a new method of speaker diarization that employs a deep learning architecture to learn speaker embeddings. In contrast to the traditional approaches that build their speaker embeddings using manually hand-crafted spectral features, we propose to train for this purpose a recurrent convolutional neural network applied directly on magnitude spectrograms. To compare our approach with the state of the art, we collect and release for the public an additional dataset of over 6 hours of fully annotated broadcast material. The results of our evaluation on the new dataset and three other benchmark datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms the competitors and reduces diarization error rate by a large margin of over 30% with respect to the baseline.

"In the paper 'Internal Model from Observations for Reward Shaping', what type of model is used to represent the expert state distribution?",ccd4c038,"Title: Internal Model from Observations for Reward Shaping

        Abstract:   Reinforcement learning methods require careful design involving a reward
function to obtain the desired action policy for a given task. In the absence
of hand-crafted reward functions, prior work on the topic has proposed several
methods for reward estimation by using expert state trajectories and action
pairs. However, there are cases where complete or good action information
cannot be obtained from expert demonstrations. We propose a novel reinforcement
learning method in which the agent learns an internal model of observation on
the basis of expert-demonstrated state trajectories to estimate rewards without
completely learning the dynamics of the external environment from state-action
pairs. The internal model is obtained in the form of a predictive model for the
given expert state distribution. During reinforcement learning, the agent
predicts the reward as a function of the difference between the actual state
and the state predicted by the internal model. We conducted multiple
experiments in environments of varying complexity, including the Super Mario
Bros and Flappy Bird games. We show our method successfully trains good
policies directly from expert game-play videos.

What challenges arise when incorporating tidal dissipation into algorithms modeling viscoelastic crustal response?,b5fb0ab9,"Title: Rotation of a synchronous viscoelastic shell

        Abstract:   Several natural satellites of the giant planets have shown evidence of a
global internal ocean, coated by a thin, icy crust. This crust is probably
viscoelastic, which would alter its rotational response. This response would
translate into several rotational quantities, i.e. the obliquity, and the
librations at different frequencies, for which the crustal elasticity reacts
differently. This study aims at modelling the global response of the

of the rotation with a digital filtering of the resulting tensor of inertia.

What factors explain the experimental observations of Klinkenberg's apparent gas permeability?,1affc023,"Title: On the apparent permeability of porous media in rarefied gas flows

the reciprocal mean gas pressure (or equivalently, the Knudsen number).
Although the underlying rarefaction effects are well-known, the reason that the
correction factor in Klinkenberg's famous equation decreases when the Knudsen
number increases has not been fully understood. Most of the studies idealize
the porous medium as a bundle of straight cylindrical tubes, however, according

factor with the Knudsen number, which clearly contradicts Klinkenberg's

Can the removal of links from a triangular lattice be used to study the effects of topological frustration on cooperation?,4e41d71d,"Title: Role-separating ordering in social dilemmas controlled by topological frustration

        Abstract:   ""Three is a crowd"" is an old proverb that applies as much to social
interactions, as it does to frustrated configurations in statistical physics
models. Accordingly, social relations within a triangle deserve special
attention. With this motivation, we explore the impact of topological
frustration on the evolutionary dynamics of the snowdrift game on a triangular
lattice. This topology provides an irreconcilable frustration, which prevents
anti-coordination of competing strategies that would be needed for an optimal
outcome of the game. By using different strategy updating protocols, we observe
complex spatial patterns in dependence on payoff values that are reminiscent to
a honeycomb-like organization, which helps to minimize the negative consequence
of the topological frustration. We relate the emergence of these patterns to
the microscopic dynamics of the evolutionary process, both by means of
mean-field approximations and Monte Carlo simulations. For comparison, we also
consider the same evolutionary dynamics on the square lattice, where of course
the topological frustration is absent. However, with the deletion of diagonal
links of the triangular lattice, we can gradually bridge the gap to the square
lattice. Interestingly, in this case the level of cooperation in the system is
a direct indicator of the level of topological frustration, thus providing a
method to determine frustration levels in an arbitrary interaction network.

accumulated, which presents an excellent opportunity for using machine learning
(ML) techniques to train models to predict wind pressures around circular
cylinders. Wind pressures around smooth circular cylinders are a function of
mainly the Reynolds number (Re), turbulence intensity (Ti) of the incident
wind, and circumferential angle of the cylinder. Considering these three
parameters as the inputs, this study trained two ML models to predict mean and
fluctuating pressures respectively. Three machine learning algorithms including
decision tree regressor, random forest, and gradient boosting regression trees

Question: Can you explain how the absence of certain data levels during training can impact model performance?

The ""absent levels"" problem is discussed in the paper ""Random Forests, Decision Trees, and Categorical Predictors: The ""Absent Levels"" Problem"". In this paper, it is stated that when decision trees based methods, such as random forests, are used to handle categorical predictors without first transforming them, it can lead to an inherent ""absent levels"" problem.

This problem occurs when an observation reaches a categorical split that was determined during training when the observation's level was absent. Although these incidents may seem innocuous, the paper shows that overlooking the absent levels problem can systematically bias a model.

Furthermore, the paper empirically demonstrates how absent levels can dramatically alter a model's performance in practice and how simple heuristics can be used to help mitigate the effects of the absent levels problem until a more robust theoretical solution is found.

Therefore, the absence of certain data levels during training can impact model performance in that it can lead to systematic bias and alter the model's performance in practice.

Abstract: One advantage of decision tree based methods like random forests is their ability to natively handle categorical predictors without having to first transform them (e.g., by using feature engineering techniques). However, in this paper, we show how this capability can lead to an inherent ""absent levels"" problem for decision tree based methods that has never been thoroughly discussed, and whose consequences have never been carefully explored.",0.83324814

What type of planner is proposed to efficiently find regrasping strategies?,737f6d89,"Title: Regrasping by Fixtureless Fixturing

object against external contact/s in the environment such that the external
contact keeps the object stationary while the fingers slide over the object. We
call this manipulation technique fixtureless fixturing. Exploiting the
mechanics of pushing, we characterize a convex polyhedral set of pushes that
results in fixtureless fixturing. These pushes are robust against uncertainty
in the object inertia, grasping force, and the friction at the contacts. We
propose a sampling-based planner that uses the sets of robust pushes to rapidly
build a tree of reachable grasps. A path in this tree is a pushing strategy,
possibly involving pushes from different sides, to regrasp the object. We
demonstrate the experimental validity and robustness of the proposed

flexible automation solutions.

articulated soft robots, due to the structures' high-dimensional nonlinear
dynamics. Control approaches have been developed which use the inverse
kinematics of tensegrity structures, either for open-loop control or as
equilibrium inputs for closed-loop controllers. However, current formulations
of the tensegrity inverse kinematics problem are limited in robotics
applications: first, they can lead to higher than needed cable tensions, and
second, may lack solutions when applied to robots with high node-to-cable
ratios. This work provides progress in both directions. To address the first
limitation, the objective function for the inverse kinematics optimization
problem is modified to produce cable tensions as low or lower than before, thus
reducing the load on the robots' motors. For the second, a reformulation of the
static equilibrium constraint is proposed, which produces solutions independent
of the number of nodes within each rigid body. Simulation results using the

How do researchers simulate a microgravity environment on Earth?,50599abe,"Title: Synchronous Observation on the Spontaneous Transformation of Liquid Metal under Free Falling Microgravity Situation

        Abstract:   The unusually high surface tension of room temperature liquid metal is
molding it as unique material for diverse newly emerging areas. However, unlike
its practices on earth, such metal fluid would display very different behaviors
when working in space where gravity disappears and surface property dominates
the major physics. So far, few direct evidences are available to understand
such effect which would impede further exploration of liquid metal use for
space. Here to preliminarily probe into this intriguing issue, a low cost
experimental strategy to simulate microgravity environment on earth was
proposed through adopting bridges with high enough free falling distance as the
test platform. Then using digital cameras amounted along x, y, z directions on
outside wall of the transparent container with liquid metal and allied solution
inside, synchronous observations on the transient flow and transformational
activities of liquid metal were performed. Meanwhile, an unmanned aerial
vehicle was adopted to record the whole free falling dynamics of the test
capsule from the far end which can help justify subsequent experimental
procedures. A series of typical fundamental phenomena were thus observed as:
(a) A relatively large liquid metal object would spontaneously transform from
its original planar pool state into a sphere and float in the container if
initiating the free falling; (b) The liquid metal changes its three-dimensional
shape due to dynamic microgravity strength due to free falling and rebound of
the test capsule; and (c) A quick spatial transformation of liquid metal
immersed in the solution can easily be induced via external electrical fields.
The mechanisms of the surface tension driven liquid metal actuation in space
were interpreted. All these findings indicated that microgravity effect should
be fully treated in developing future generation liquid metal space
technologies.

How does a convolutional neural network contribute to approximating fluid simulation velocity fields in a generative model?,7a72be56,"Title: Deep Fluids: A Generative Network for Parameterized Fluid Simulations

        Abstract:   This paper presents a novel generative model to synthesize fluid simulations
from a set of reduced parameters. A convolutional neural network is trained on
a collection of discrete, parameterizable fluid simulation velocity fields. Due
to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative
features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate
the training data set, while providing plausible interpolated in-betweens. The
proposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that
guarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we
demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and
advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second
network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling
applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids
with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and
compression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are
generated up to 700x faster than traditional CPU solvers, while achieving
compression rates of over 1300x.

What types of robots benefit from predicting future environmental changes?,4cf21ba0,"Title: One-Step Time-Dependent Future Video Frame Prediction with a Convolutional Encoder-Decoder Neural Network

        Abstract:   There is an inherent need for autonomous cars, drones, and other robots to
have a notion of how their environment behaves and to anticipate changes in the
near future. In this work, we focus on anticipating future appearance given the
current frame of a video. Existing work focuses on either predicting the future
appearance as the next frame of a video, or predicting future motion as optical
flow or motion trajectories starting from a single video frame. This work
stretches the ability of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to predict an
anticipation of appearance at an arbitrarily given future time, not necessarily
the next video frame. We condition our predicted future appearance on a
continuous time variable that allows us to anticipate future frames at a given
temporal distance, directly from the input video frame. We show that CNNs can
learn an intrinsic representation of typical appearance changes over time and
successfully generate realistic predictions at a deliberate time difference in
the near future.

What are the consequences of overestimating and underestimating long-term electricity load?,2890ff2b,"Title: Long-Term Load Forecasting Considering Volatility Using Multiplicative Error Model

        Abstract:   Long-term load forecasting plays a vital role for utilities and planners in
terms of grid development and expansion planning. An overestimate of long-term
electricity load will result in substantial wasted investment in the
construction of excess power facilities, while an underestimate of future load
will result in insufficient generation and unmet demand. This paper presents
first-of-its-kind approach to use multiplicative error model (MEM) in
forecasting load for long-term horizon. MEM originates from the structure of
autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model where conditional
variance is dynamically parameterized and it multiplicatively interacts with an
innovation term of time-series. Historical load data, accessed from a U.S.
regional transmission operator, and recession data for years 1993-2016 is used
in this study. The superiority of considering volatility is proven by
out-of-sample forecast results as well as directional accuracy during the great
economic recession of 2008. To incorporate future volatility, backtesting of
MEM model is performed. Two performance indicators used to assess the proposed
model are mean absolute percentage error (for both in-sample model fit and
out-of-sample forecasts) and directional accuracy.

What does this functional expand the energy in?,770970c4,"Title: From bare interactions, low--energy constants and unitary gas to nuclear density functionals without free parameters: application to neutron matter

        Abstract:   We further progress along the line of Ref. [Phys. Rev. {\bf A 94}, 043614
(2016)] where a functional for Fermi systems with anomalously large $s$-wave
scattering length $a_s$ was proposed that has no free parameters. The
functional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases
together with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at
low density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities
$\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang
functional, valid for $\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional
retained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional
corresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all
orders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One
conclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density
regime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with
respect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce
density--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare
interaction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some
of the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas
properties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that
the scale in the s-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the
so-called Bertsch parameter $\xi_0$ and becomes independent of $a_s$. We also
point out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those
empirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional. We finally
propose a slight modification of the functional such that it becomes accurate
up to the saturation density $\rho\simeq 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$.

What are the advantages of  separately considering different kernels in a kernel method when dealing with temporal data?,583dcadc,"Title: Recursive Multikernel Filters Exploiting Nonlinear Temporal Structure

        Abstract:   In kernel methods, temporal information on the data is commonly included by
using time-delayed embeddings as inputs. Recently, an alternative formulation
was proposed by defining a gamma-filter explicitly in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space, giving rise to a complex model where multiple kernels operate on
different temporal combinations of the input signal. In the original
formulation, the kernels are then simply combined to obtain a single kernel
matrix (for instance by averaging), which provides computational benefits but
discards important information on the temporal structure of the signal.
Inspired by works on multiple kernel learning, we overcome this drawback by
considering the different kernels separately. We propose an efficient strategy
to adaptively combine and select these kernels during the training phase. The
resulting batch and online algorithms automatically learn to process highly
nonlinear temporal information extracted from the input signal, which is
implicitly encoded in the kernel values. We evaluate our proposal on several
artificial and real tasks, showing that it can outperform classical approaches
both in batch and online settings.

transits; transits are deeper in the redder bands, with a u'-r' colour
difference of up to ~-0.05 mag. We explore various possible explanations for
the bluing. 'Spectral' photometry obtained by integrating over bandpasses in
the spectroscopic data in- and out-of-transit, compared to the photometric
data, shows that the observed colour difference is most likely the result of
reduced circumstellar absorption in the spectrum during transits. This
indicates that the transiting objects and the gas share the same line-of-sight,
and that the gas covers the white dwarf only partially, as would be expected if
the gas, the transiting debris, and the dust emitting the infrared excess, are
part of the same general disc structure (although possibly at different radii).
In addition, we present the results of a week-long monitoring campaign of the
system.

What are the limitations of using U-Net for sparse-view CT reconstruction?,7e3b01ed,"Title: Framing U-Net via Deep Convolutional Framelets: Application to Sparse-view CT

        Abstract:   X-ray computed tomography (CT) using sparse projection views is a recent
approach to reduce the radiation dose. However, due to the insufficient
projection views, an analytic reconstruction approach using the filtered back
projection (FBP) produces severe streaking artifacts. Recently, deep learning
approaches using large receptive field neural networks such as U-Net have
demonstrated impressive performance for sparse- view CT reconstruction.
However, theoretical justification is still lacking. Inspired by the recent
theory of deep convolutional framelets, the main goal of this paper is,
therefore, to reveal the limitation of U-Net and propose new multi-resolution
deep learning schemes. In particular, we show that the alternative U- Net
variants such as dual frame and the tight frame U-Nets satisfy the so-called
frame condition which make them better for effective recovery of high frequency
edges in sparse view- CT. Using extensive experiments with real patient data
set, we demonstrate that the new network architectures provide better
reconstruction performance.

formula for odd zeta values which, for $N$ odd and $m>0$, gives a relation
between $\zeta(2m+1)$ and $\zeta(2Nm+1)$. A result complementary to the
aforementioned generalization is obtained for any even $N$ and
$m\in\mathbb{Z}$. It generalizes a transformation of Wigert and can be regarded
as a formula for $\zeta\left(2m+1-\frac{1}{N}\right)$. Applications of these

How does the author argue that strategic voting can be problematic in voting systems other than majority rule?,c01d2b5f,"Title: Why Condorcet Consistency is Essential

        Abstract:   In a single winner election with several candidates and ranked choice or
rating scale ballots, a Condorcet winner is one who wins all their two way
races by majority rule or MR. A voting system has Condorcet consistency or CC
if it names any Condorcet winner the winner. Many voting systems lack CC, but a
three step line of reasoning is used here to show why it is necessary. In step
1 we show that we can dismiss all the electoral criteria which conflict with
CC. In step 2 we point out that CC follows almost automatically if we can agree
that MR is the only acceptable system for elections with two candidates. In
step 3 we make that argument for MR. This argument itself has three parts.
First, in races with two candidates, the only well known alternatives to MR can
sometimes name as winner a candidate who is preferred over their opponent by
only one voter, with all others preferring the opponent. That is unacceptable.
Second, those same systems are also extremely susceptible to strategic
insincere voting. Third, in simulation studies using spatial models with two
candidates, the best known alternative to MR picks the best or most centrist
candidate significantly less often than MR does.

        Abstract:   Constraint Handling Rules is an effective concurrent declarative programming
language and a versatile computational logic formalism. CHR programs consist of
guarded reactive rules that transform multisets of constraints. One of the main
features of CHR is its inherent concurrency. Intuitively, rules can be applied
to parts of a multiset in parallel. In this comprehensive survey, we give an
overview of concurrent and parallel as well as distributed CHR semantics,
standard and more exotic, that have been proposed over the years at various
levels of refinement. These semantics range from the abstract to the concrete.
They are related by formal soundness results. Their correctness is established
as correspondence between parallel and sequential computations. We present
common concise sample CHR programs that have been widely used in experiments
and benchmarks. We review parallel CHR implementations in software and
hardware. The experimental results obtained show a consistent parallel speedup.

        Abstract:   We develop the theoretical foundations of a network distance that has
recently been applied to various subfields of topological data analysis, namely
persistent homology and hierarchical clustering. While this network distance
has previously appeared in the context of finite networks, we extend the
setting to that of compact networks. The main challenge in this new setting is
the lack of an easy notion of sampling from compact networks; we solve this
problem in the process of obtaining our results. The generality of our setting
means that we automatically establish results for exotic objects such as
directed metric spaces and Finsler manifolds. We identify readily computable
network invariants and establish their quantitative stability under this
network distance. We also discuss the computational complexity involved in
precisely computing this distance, and develop easily-computable lower bounds
by using the identified invariants. By constructing a wide range of explicit
examples, we show that these lower bounds are effective in distinguishing
between networks. Finally, we provide a simple algorithm that computes a lower
bound on the distance between two networks in polynomial time and illustrate
our metric and invariant constructions on a database of random networks and a
database of simulated hippocampal networks.

Title: Physical problem solving: Joint planning with symbolic, geometric, and dynamic constraints

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new task that investigates how people interact with and make judgments about towers of blocks. In Experiment~1, participants in the lab solved a series of problems in which they had to re-configure three blocks from an initial to a final configuration. We recorded whether they used one hand or two hands to do so. In Experiment~2, we asked participants online to judge whether they think the person in the lab used one or two hands. The results revealed a close correspondence between participants' actions in the lab, and the mental simulations of participants online. To explain participants' actions and mental simulations, we develop a model that plans over a symbolic representation of the situation, executes the plan using a geometric solver, and checks the plan's feasibility by taking into account the physical constraints of the scene. Our model explains participants' actions and judgments to a high degree of quantitative accuracy.

This paper presents a model that can accurately predict how people will physically manipulate blocks. The model takes into account the symbolic representation of the situation, the geometric constraints of the blocks, and the physical constraints of the scene.",0.9551507
How do these new algorithms compare to existing state-of-the-art optimization and MCMC algorithms?,39310759,"Title: Split-and-augmented Gibbs sampler - Application to large-scale inference problems

        Abstract:   This paper derives two new optimization-driven Monte Carlo algorithms
inspired from variable splitting and data augmentation. In particular, the
formulation of one of the proposed approaches is closely related to the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) main steps. The proposed
framework enables to derive faster and more efficient sampling schemes than the
current state-of-the-art methods and can embed the latter. By sampling
efficiently the parameter to infer as well as the hyperparameters of the
problem, the generated samples can be used to approximate Bayesian estimators
of the parameters to infer. Additionally, the proposed approach brings
confidence intervals at a low cost contrary to optimization methods.
Simulations on two often-studied signal processing problems illustrate the
performance of the two proposed samplers. All results are compared to those
obtained by recent state-of-the-art optimization and MCMC algorithms used to
solve these problems.
","Based on the provided abstracts, here's a comparison of the new algorithms to existing state-of-the-art optimization and MCMC algorithms:

**Optimization Algorithms:**

* Fractional Langevin Monte Carlo (FLMC) has better asymptotic properties but is shown to have a faster increase in weak-error compared to Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC). Therefore, FLMC may not be directly comparable to LMC, but rather complementary.

**MCMC Algorithms:**

* Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a well-established algorithm, and Primal-Dual MCTS is a new variant that has been shown to improve upon standard MCTS in certain scenarios.
* Continuously Tempered Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (CT-HMC) is a new method that has been shown to improve mixing in multimodal targets and allow for estimation of the normalizing constant of the target distribution. This is a significant improvement over existing methods.
* An Asymptotically Efficient Metropolis-Hastings Sampler (AEMS) has been developed for Bayesian inference in large-scale educational measurements, but its comparison to other MCMC algorithms is not explicitly discussed in the abstract.

**Image Recognition Algorithms:**

* Learning Transferable Architectures for Scalable Image Recognition (NASNet) has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on several image recognition tasks, including CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and COCO, while reducing computational demand.

These new algorithms appear to offer improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods in certain scenarios, but further evaluation and comparison are necessary to fully understand their merits.",0.4822435

How can wearable technology be incorporated into a system for preventing hospital acquired infections?,c83b95cf,"Title: Preventing Hospital Acquired Infections Through a Workflow-Based Cyber-Physical System

HAI are a serious world-wide problem, leading to an increase in mortality

as deterministic finite automata without non-trivial cycles, which are
structurally the simplest deadlock-free DESs. We show that even for such very

How does this approach compare to other black-box methods that rely on distance metrics like L_p norms for finding adversarial examples? ,26fc34de,"Title: Perception-in-the-Loop Adversarial Examples

internal structure, parameters, or intermediate confidence values.
Perception-in-the-loop means that the notion of proximity between inputs can be
directly queried from human participants rather than an arbitrarily chosen
metric. Our technique is based on covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES), a black box optimization approach. CMA-ES explores the

candidates according to a distribution, choosing the best candidates according
to a cost function, and updating the posterior distribution to favor the best
candidates. We run CMA-ES using human participants to provide the fitness
function, using the insight that the choice of best candidates in CMA-ES can be
naturally modeled as a perception task: pick the top $k$ inputs perceptually
closest to a fixed input. We empirically demonstrate that finding adversarial
examples is feasible using small populations and few iterations. We compare the
performance of CMA-ES on the MNIST benchmark with other black-box approaches
using $L_p$ norms as a cost function, and show that it performs favorably both

What types of electronic structure calculations reveal the existence of topologically invariant surface states in cubic bismuth perovskites?,03dfd8d7,"Title: Topologically Invariant Double Dirac States in Bismuth based Perovskites: Consequence of Ambivalent Charge States and Covalent Bonding

        Abstract:   Bulk and surface electronic structures, calculated using density functional
theory and a tight-binding model Hamiltonian, reveal the existence of two
topologically invariant (TI) surface states in the family of cubic Bi
perovskites (ABiO$_3$; A = Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba). The two TI
states, one lying in the valence band (TI-V) and other lying in the conduction
band (TI-C) are formed out of bonding and antibonding states of the
Bi-$\{$s,p$\}$ - O-$\{$p$\}$ coordinated covalent interaction. Below a certain
critical thickness of the film, which varies with A, TI states of top and
bottom surfaces couple to destroy the Dirac type linear dispersion and
consequently to open surface energy gaps. The origin of s-p band inversion,
necessary to form a TI state, classifies the family of ABiO$_3$ into two. For
class-I (A = Na, K, Rb, Cs and Mg) the band inversion, leading to TI-C state,
is induced by spin-orbit coupling of the Bi-p states and for class-II (A = Ca,
Sr and Ba) the band inversion is induced through weak but sensitive second
neighbor Bi-Bi interactions.

What is the intrinsic superconducting anisotropy of Sr2RuO4 determined from vortex lattice distortion?,c8264de7,"Title: Anisotropy and multiband superconductivity in Sr2RuO4

        Abstract:   Despite numerous studies the exact nature of the order parameter in
superconducting Sr2RuO4 remains unresolved. We have extended previous
small-angle neutron scattering studies of the vortex lattice in this material
to a wider field range, higher temperatures, and with the field applied close
to both the <100> and <110> basal plane directions. Measurements at high field
were made possible by the use of both spin polarization and analysis to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio. Rotating the field towards the basal plane causes a
distortion of the square vortex lattice observed for H // <001>, and also a
symmetry change to a distorted triangular symmetry for fields close to <100>.
The vortex lattice distortion allows us to determine the intrinsic
superconducting anisotropy between the c-axis and the Ru-O basal plane,
yielding a value of ~60 at low temperature and low to intermediate fields. This
greatly exceeds the upper critical field anisotropy of ~20 at low temperature,
reminiscent of Pauli limiting. Indirect evidence for Pauli paramagnetic effects
on the unpaired quasiparticles in the vortex cores are observed, but a direct
detection lies below the measurement sensitivity. The superconducting
anisotropy is found to be independent of temperature but increases for fields >
1 T, indicating multiband superconductvity in Sr2RuO4. Finally, the temperature
dependence of the scattered intensity provides further support for gap nodes or
deep minima in the superconducting gap.

How does this new measure of nonclassicality differentiate between the total Wehrl entropy of a state and its classical characteristics?,a49eaf59,"Title: Wehrl Entropy Based Quantification of Nonclassicality for Single Mode Quantum Optical States

        Abstract:   Nonclassical states of a quantized light are described in terms of
Glauber-Sudarshan P distribution which is not a genuine classical probability
distribution. Despite several attempts, defining a uniform measure of
nonclassicality (NC) for the single mode quantum states of light is yet an open
task. In our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 95, 012330 (2017)] we have shown that
the existing well-known measures fail to quantify the NC of single mode states
that are generated under multiple NC-inducing operations. Recently, Ivan et.
al. [Quantum. Inf. Process. 11, 853 (2012)] have defined a measure of
non-Gaussian character of quantum optical states in terms of Wehrl entropy.
Here, we adopt this concept in the context of single mode NC. In this paper, we
propose a new quantification of NC for the single mode quantum states of light
as the difference between the total Wehrl entropy of the state and the maximum
Wehrl entropy arising due to its classical characteristics. This we achieve by
subtracting from its Wehrl entropy, the maximum Wehrl entropy attainable by any
classical state that has same randomness as measured in terms of von-Neumann
entropy. We obtain analytic expressions of NC for most of the states, in
particular, all pure states and Gaussian mixed states. However, the evaluation
of NC for the non-Gaussian mixed states is subject to extensive numerical
computation that lies beyond the scope of the current work. We show that, along
with the states generated under single NC-inducing operations, also for the
broader class of states that are generated under multiple NC-inducing
operations, our quantification enumerates the NC consistently.

What are the limitations of using the algorithmic Markov condition for causal inference?,663a6d9c,"Title: Causal Inference by Stochastic Complexity

the lowest Kolmogorov complexity. Due to the halting problem, however, this
notion is not computable.
We hence propose to do causal inference by stochastic complexity. That is, we
propose to approximate Kolmogorov complexity via the Minimum Description Length
(MDL) principle, using a score that is mini-max optimal with regard to the
model class under consideration. This means that even in an adversarial
setting, such as when the true distribution is not in this class, we still
obtain the optimal encoding for the data relative to the class.
We instantiate this framework, which we call CISC, for pairs of univariate
discrete variables, using the class of multinomial distributions. Experiments
show that CISC is highly accurate on synthetic, benchmark, as well as
real-world data, outperforming the state of the art by a margin, and scales
extremely well with regard to sample and domain sizes.

Abstract: In the context of orientable circuits and subcomplexes of these as representing certain singular spaces, we consider characteristic class formulas generalizing those classical results as seen for the Riemann-Hurwitz formula for regulating the topology of branched covering maps and that for monoidal transformations which include the standard blowing-up process. Here the results are presented as cap product pairings, which will be elements of a suitable homology theory, rather than characteristic numbers as would be the case when taking Kronecker products once Poincaré duality is defined. We further consider possible applications and examples including branched covering maps, singular varieties involving virtual tangent bundles, the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson class, the homology L-class, generalized signature, and the cohomology signature class.",0.81034905
How do starting time and aging effects influence the epidemic threshold in temporal networks with memory?,71a12111,"Title: Epidemic Spreading and Aging in Temporal Networks with Memory

        Abstract:   Time-varying network topologies can deeply influence dynamical processes
mediated by them. Memory effects in the pattern of interactions among
individuals are also known to affect how diffusive and spreading phenomena take
place. In this paper we analyze the combined effect of these two ingredients on
epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible
(SIS) and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models on the recently
introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based
mean-field approach we derive, in the long time limit, analytical predictions
for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the
distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results
show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR
dynamics, therefore favouring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach
perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long time asymptotic regime.
Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic
threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss
in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose
understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated
temporal networks.

What is the transitional Strouhal number and how does it influence the wake shedding pattern of a cylinder?,60350b39,"Title: Mass and moment of inertia govern the transition in the dynamics and wakes of freely rising and falling cylinders

        Abstract:   In this Letter, we study the motion and wake-patterns of freely rising and
falling cylinders in quiescent fluid. We show that the amplitude of oscillation
and the overall system-dynamics are intricately linked to two parameters: the
particle's mass-density relative to the fluid $m^* \equiv \rho_p/\rho_f$ and
its relative moment-of-inertia $I^* \equiv {I}_p/{I}_f$. This supersedes the
current understanding that a critical mass density ($m^*\approx$ 0.54) alone
triggers the sudden onset of vigorous vibrations. Using over 144 combinations
of ${m}^*$ and $I^*$, we comprehensively map out the parameter space covering
very heavy ($m^* > 10$) to very buoyant ($m^* < 0.1$) particles. The entire
data collapses into two scaling regimes demarcated by a transitional Strouhal
number, $St_t \approx 0.17$. $St_t$ separates a mass-dominated regime from a
regime dominated by the particle's moment of inertia. A shift from one regime
to the other also marks a gradual transition in the wake-shedding pattern: from
the classical $2S$~(2-Single) vortex mode to a $2P$~(2-Pairs) vortex mode.
Thus, auto-rotation can have a significant influence on the trajectories and
wakes of freely rising isotropic bodies.

What are some limitations of Temporal Ensembling for training large datasets?,9b29cb1e,"Title: Mean teachers are better role models: Weight-averaged consistency targets improve semi-supervised deep learning results

        Abstract:   The recently proposed Temporal Ensembling has achieved state-of-the-art
results in several semi-supervised learning benchmarks. It maintains an
exponential moving average of label predictions on each training example, and
penalizes predictions that are inconsistent with this target. However, because
the targets change only once per epoch, Temporal Ensembling becomes unwieldy
when learning large datasets. To overcome this problem, we propose Mean
Teacher, a method that averages model weights instead of label predictions. As
an additional benefit, Mean Teacher improves test accuracy and enables training
with fewer labels than Temporal Ensembling. Without changing the network
architecture, Mean Teacher achieves an error rate of 4.35% on SVHN with 250
labels, outperforming Temporal Ensembling trained with 1000 labels. We also
show that a good network architecture is crucial to performance. Combining Mean
Teacher and Residual Networks, we improve the state of the art on CIFAR-10 with

spiked covariance model, we empirically show that the primal-dual approach
outperforms the spectral method. We also examine the performance of the

offer a unique way to constrain the shape of galactic gravitational potentials.
Such streams can be used as leaning tower gravitational experiments on galactic
scales. The most well motivated modification of gravity proposed as an
alternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND),
and we present here the first ever N-body simulations of the dynamical
evolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a
realistic baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we attempt to reproduce the
present-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf and its
immense tidal stream that wraps around the Milky Way. With very little freedom
on the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total
luminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size
relation for isolated dwarf galaxies, we find reasonable agreement between our
simulations and observations of this system. The observed stellar velocities in
the leading arm can be reproduced if we include a massive hot gas corona around

estimates in phylogenetic analyses, it is standard practice to employ
statistical approaches based on stochastic models of sequence evolution on a
tree. For tractability, such models necessarily make simplifying assumptions
about the evolutionary mechanisms involved. In particular, commonly omitted are
insertions and deletions of nucleotides -- also known as indels.
Properly accounting for indels in statistical phylogenetic analyses remains a
major challenge in computational evolutionary biology. Here we consider the
problem of reconstructing ancestral sequences on a known phylogeny in a model
of sequence evolution incorporating nucleotide substitutions, insertions and
deletions, specifically the classical TKF91 process. We focus on the case of
dense phylogenies of bounded height, which we refer to as the taxon-rich
setting, where statistical consistency is achievable. We give the first
polynomial-time ancestral reconstruction algorithm with provable guarantees
under constant rates of mutation. Our algorithm succeeds when the phylogeny
satisfies the ""big bang"" condition, a necessary and sufficient condition for
statistical consistency in this context.

What is the discrepancy found in the X-ray emissions of Alpha Persei compared to similar stars?,cbb39b5c,"Title: A Closer Look at the Alpha Persei Coronal Conundrum

        Abstract:   A ROSAT survey of the Alpha Per open cluster in 1993 detected its brightest
star, mid-F supergiant Alpha Persei: the X-ray luminosity and spectral hardness
were similar to coronally active late-type dwarf members. Later, in 2010, a
Hubble Cosmic Origins Spectrograph SNAPshot of Alpha Persei found
far-ultraviolet coronal proxy SiIV unexpectedly weak. This, and a suspicious
offset of the ROSAT source, suggested that a late-type companion might be
responsible for the X-rays. Recently, a multi-faceted program tested that
premise. Groundbased optical coronography, and near-UV imaging with HST Wide
Field Camera 3, searched for any close-in faint candidate coronal objects, but
without success. Then, a Chandra pointing found the X-ray source single and
coincident with the bright star. Significantly, the SiIV emissions of Alpha
Persei, in a deeper FUV spectrum collected by HST COS as part of the joint
program, aligned well with chromospheric atomic oxygen (which must be intrinsic
to the luminous star), within the context of cooler late-F and early-G
supergiants, including Cepheid variables. This pointed to the X-rays as the
fundamental anomaly. The over-luminous X-rays still support the case for a
hyperactive dwarf secondary, albeit now spatially unresolved. However, an
alternative is that Alpha Persei represents a novel class of coronal source.
Resolving the first possibility now has become more difficult, because the easy
solution -- a well separated companion -- has been eliminated. Testing the
other possibility will require a broader high-energy census of the early-F
supergiants.

Abstract: Widespread use of social media has led to the generation of substantial amounts of information about individuals, including health-related information. Social media provides the opportunity to study health-related information about selected population groups who may be of interest for a particular study. In this paper, we explore the possibility of utilizing social media to perform targeted data collection and analysis from a particular population group -- pregnant women. We hypothesize that we can use social media to identify cohorts of pregnant women and follow them over time to analyze crucial health-related information. To identify potentially pregnant women, we employ simple rule-based searches that attempt to detect pregnancy announcements with moderate precision. To further filter out false positives and noise, we employ a supervised classifier using a small number of hand-annotated data. We then collect their posts over time to create longitudinal health timelines and attempt to divide the timelines into different pregnancy trimesters. Finally, we assess the usefulness of the timelines by performing a preliminary analysis to estimate drug intake patterns of our cohort at different trimesters. Our rule-based cohort identification technique collected 53,820 users over thirty months from Twitter.

How does the Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) method enable adaptation of parameter importance based on unlabeled data?,5daa856c,"Title: Memory Aware Synapses: Learning what (not) to forget

overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used
knowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems,
lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over
tasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that,
given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be
learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by
neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined
Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a
neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which
is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter
of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a
change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important
parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge
related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an
interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb's

        Abstract:   Deep learning has been successfully applied to various tasks, but its
underlying mechanism remains unclear. Neural networks associate similar inputs
in the visible layer to the same state of hidden variables in deep layers. The
fraction of inputs that are associated to the same state is a natural measure
of similarity and is simply related to the cost in bits required to represent
these inputs. The degeneracy of states with the same information cost provides
instead a natural measure of noise and is simply related the entropy of the
frequency of states, that we call relevance. Representations with minimal
noise, at a given level of similarity (resolution), are those that maximise the
relevance. A signature of such efficient representations is that frequency
distributions follow power laws. We show, in extensive numerical experiments,
that deep neural networks extract a hierarchy of efficient representations from
data, because they i) achieve low levels of noise (i.e. high relevance) and ii)
exhibit power law distributions. We also find that the layer that is most
efficient to reliably generate patterns of training data is the one for which
relevance and resolution are traded at the same price, which implies that
frequency distribution follows Zipf's law.

","Title: Fast Multi-frame Stereo Scene Flow with Motion Segmentation

Abstract:   We propose a new multi-frame method for efficiently computing scene flow
(dense depth and optical flow) and camera ego-motion for a dynamic scene
observed from a moving stereo camera rig. Our technique also segments out
moving objects from the rigid scene. In our method, we first estimate the
disparity map and the 6-DOF camera motion using stereo matching and visual
odometry. We then identify regions inconsistent with the estimated camera
motion and compute per-pixel optical flow only at these regions. This flow
proposal is fused with the camera motion-based flow proposal using fusion moves
to obtain the final optical flow and motion segmentation.

The abstract suggests that a stereo camera rig improves the accuracy of optical flow and visual odometry by allowing for the estimation of disparity maps and 6-DOF camera motion, which are then used to identify regions inconsistent with the estimated camera motion and compute per-pixel optical flow only at these regions. This approach leads to more accurate optical flow and motion segmentation.",0.9211767
What are the limitations of applying the smooth pasting principle to time-inconsistent optimal stopping problems?,fd335522,"Title: Failure of Smooth Pasting Principle and Nonexistence of Equilibrium Stopping Rules under Time-Inconsistency

        Abstract:   This paper considers a time-inconsistent stopping problem in which the
inconsistency arises from non-constant time preference rates. We show that the
smooth pasting principle, the main approach that has been used to construct
explicit solutions for conventional time-consistent optimal stopping problems,
may fail under time-inconsistency. Specifically, we prove that the smooth
pasting principle solves a time-inconsistent problem within the intra-personal
game theoretic framework if and only if a certain inequality on the model
primitives is satisfied. We show that the violation of this inequality can
happen even for very simple non-exponential discount functions. Moreover, we
demonstrate that the stopping problem does not admit any intra-personal
equilibrium whenever the smooth pasting principle fails. The ""negative"" results
in this paper caution blindly extending the classical approaches for
time-consistent stopping problems to their time-inconsistent counterparts.

the exponential sum over the $p$-set. Based on the result, one shows that the

        Abstract:   Neuroscientists classify neurons into different types that perform similar
computations at different locations in the visual field. Traditional methods
for neural system identification do not capitalize on this separation of 'what'

many neurons provides an exciting path forward, but the architectural design
needs to account for data limitations: While new experimental techniques enable
recordings from thousands of neurons, experimental time is limited so that one

How can we regulate the complexity of the inference model in a variational autoencoder?,db99fa73,"Title: Amortized Inference Regularization

        Abstract:   The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular model for density estimation

prefer an expressive inference model so that the variational approximation is
accurate. However, it is often overlooked that an overly-expressive inference
model can be detrimental to the test set performance of both the amortized

propose techniques for amortized inference regularization (AIR) that control
the smoothness of the inference model. We demonstrate that, by applying AIR, it
is possible to improve VAE generalization on both inference and generative

a mechanism for approximating maximum likelihood training and illustrates that

the Henze-Penrose bounds on the pairwise Bayes misclassification rates that
rank the binary subproblems in terms of difficulty of classification. The
proposed empirical estimates of the Bayes error rate are computed from the
minimal spanning tree (MST) of the samples from each pair of classes. Moreover,
a meta-learning technique is presented for quantifying the one-vs-rest Bayes

Abstract: The paper studies bidirectional communication in a decode-and-forward relay assisted cooperative wireless network in the presence of co-channel interference (CCI). The authors derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability of the system for both power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) mode of operation of the relay. Simulation results are used to validate the accuracy of the analytical results and illustrate the dependence of the outage probability on various system parameters, like PS factor, TS factor, and distance of the relay from both the users. Additionally, the paper compares the performance of PS relaying (PSR) and TS relaying (TSR) schemes in terms of energy-efficiency, showing that PSR is superior to TSR protocol in terms of peak energy-efficiency.

How does the proposed method compare to SGD in terms of training data requirements and performance on image datasets like MNIST and CIFAR?,54dcbe43,"Title: Separation of time scales and direct computation of weights in deep neural networks

        Abstract:   Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing our lives at an ever increasing
pace. At the heart of this revolution is the recent advancements in deep neural
networks (DNN), learning to perform sophisticated, high-level tasks. However,
training DNNs requires massive amounts of data and is very computationally
intensive. Gaining analytical understanding of the solutions found by DNNs can
help us devise more efficient training algorithms, replacing the commonly used
mthod of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We analyze the dynamics of SGD and
show that, indeed, direct computation of the solutions is possible in many
cases. We show that a high performing setup used in DNNs introduces a
separation of time-scales in the training dynamics, allowing SGD to train
layers from the lowest (closest to input) to the highest. We then show that for
each layer, the distribution of solutions found by SGD can be estimated using a
class-based principal component analysis (PCA) of the layer's input. This
finding allows us to forgo SGD entirely and directly derive the DNN parameters
using this class-based PCA, which can be well estimated using significantly
less data than SGD. We implement these results on image datasets MNIST, CIFAR10
and CIFAR100 and find that, in fact, layers derived using our class-based PCA
perform comparable or superior to neural networks of the same size and
architecture trained using SGD. We also confirm that the class-based PCA often
converges using a fraction of the data required for SGD. Thus, using our method
training time can be reduced both by requiring less training data than SGD, and
by eliminating layers in the costly backpropagation step of the training.

What are the implications of identifying multiple core-periphery pairs in an interbank market?,4f903d8a,"Title: Structural changes in the interbank market across the financial crisis from multiple core-periphery analysis

internally. This paradigm has recently been challenged for short time scales,
where interbank markets seem better characterised by a bipartite structure with
more core-periphery connections than inside the core. Using a novel
core-periphery detection method on the eMID interbank market, we enrich this
picture by showing that the network is actually characterised by multiple
core-periphery pairs. Moreover, a transition from core-periphery to bipartite
structures occurs by shortening the temporal scale of data aggregation. We
further show how the global financial crisis transformed the market, in terms

Title: Structural changes in the interbank market across the financial crisis from multiple core-periphery analysis

Abstract: ...Using a novel core-periphery detection method on the eMID interbank market, we enrich this picture by showing that the network is actually characterised by multiple core-periphery pairs. Moreover, a transition from core-periphery to bipartite structures occurs by shortening the temporal scale of data aggregation. We further show how the global financial crisis transformed the market, in terms of composition, multiplicity and internal organisation of core-periphery pairs.

In this paper, the researchers discuss the implications of identifying multiple core-periphery pairs in an interbank market. According to the abstract, these findings suggest that the interbank market is characterised by multiple core-periphery pairs, which is different from the traditional view of a single core-periphery structure. This discovery highlights the complexity of interbank relationships during the financial crisis, indicating that banks may be more interconnected than previously thought. The study also suggests that the crisis led to a transformation of the market, altering the composition, multiplicity, and internal organisation of core-periphery pairs.

In summary, the implications of identifying multiple core-periphery pairs in an interbank market are:

* The interbank market is more complex than previously thought, with multiple core-periphery pairs instead of a single structure.
* Banks may be more interconnected than previously thought, which can lead to a greater risk of contagion and systemic instability.
* The financial crisis has transformed the interbank market, leading to changes in the composition, multiplicity, and internal organisation of core-periphery pairs.

What technique is used to prevent 'buzzy-sounding' speech during voice conversion?,aa9061d2,"Title: ACVAE-VC: Non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion with auxiliary classifier variational autoencoder

        Abstract:   This paper proposes a non-parallel many-to-many voice conversion (VC) method
using a variant of the conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) called an
auxiliary classifier VAE (ACVAE). The proposed method has three key features.
First, it adopts fully convolutional architectures to construct the encoder and
decoder networks so that the networks can learn conversion rules that capture
time dependencies in the acoustic feature sequences of source and target
speech. Second, it uses an information-theoretic regularization for the model
training to ensure that the information in the attribute class label will not
be lost in the conversion process. With regular CVAEs, the encoder and decoder
are free to ignore the attribute class label input. This can be problematic
since in such a situation, the attribute class label will have little effect on
controlling the voice characteristics of input speech at test time. Such
situations can be avoided by introducing an auxiliary classifier and training
the encoder and decoder so that the attribute classes of the decoder outputs
are correctly predicted by the classifier. Third, it avoids producing
buzzy-sounding speech at test time by simply transplanting the spectral details
of the input speech into its converted version. Subjective evaluation
experiments revealed that this simple method worked reasonably well in a
non-parallel many-to-many speaker identity conversion task.

First of all, in our new scheme, agents use uncoordinated step-sizes and the
stable upper bounds on step-sizes are independent from network topology. The
step-sizes depend on local objective functions, and they can be as large as
that of the gradient descent. Secondly, for the special case without non-smooth
terms, linear convergence can be achieved under the strong convexity
assumption. The dependence of the convergence rate on the objective functions
and the network are separated, and the convergence rate of our new scheme is as
good as one of the two convergence rates that match the typical rates for the
general gradient descent and the consensus averaging. We also provide some

        Abstract:   Parametric resonance is among the most efficient phenomena generating
gravitational waves (GWs) in the early Universe. The dynamics of parametric
resonance, and hence of the GWs, depend exclusively on the resonance parameter
$q$. The latter is determined by the properties of each scenario: the initial
amplitude and potential curvature of the oscillating field, and its coupling to
other species. Previous works have only studied the GW production for fixed
value(s) of $q$. We present an analytical derivation of the GW amplitude
dependence on $q$, valid for any scenario, which we confront against numerical
results. By running lattice simulations in an expanding grid, we study for a
wide range of $q$ values, the production of GWs in post-inflationary preheating
scenarios driven by parametric resonance. We present simple fits for the final
amplitude and position of the local maxima in the GW spectrum. Our
parametrization allows to predict the location and amplitude of the GW
background today, for an arbitrary $q$. The GW signal can be rather large, as
$h^2\Omega_{\rm GW}(f_p) \lesssim 10^{-11}$, but it is always peaked at high
frequencies $f_p \gtrsim 10^{7}$ Hz. We also discuss the case of

The dynamics of parametric resonance, and hence of the GWs, depend exclusively on the resonance parameter q. The latter is determined by the properties of each scenario: the initial amplitude and potential curvature of the oscillating field, and its coupling to other species. Previous works have only studied the GW production for fixed value(s) of q. We present an analytical derivation of the GW amplitude dependence on q, valid for any scenario, which we confront against numerical results. By running lattice simulations in an expanding grid, we study for a wide range of q values, the production of GWs in post-inflationary preheating scenarios driven by parametric resonance. We present simple fits for the final amplitude and position of the local maxima in the GW spectrum. Our parametrization allows to predict the location and amplitude of the GW background today, for an arbitrary q.

According to the abstract, the analytical derivation of gravitational wave amplitude dependence on q can be applied to any scenario, including those with spectator fields, as long as the initial amplitude and potential curvature of the oscillating field and its coupling to other species are taken into account.",0.9600662
Which video datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and how did it compare to existing methods?,9329dc97,"Title: Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for Action Detection in Videos

        Abstract:   Deep learning has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for image
classification and object detection. However, the impact of deep learning on
video analysis (e.g. action detection and recognition) has been limited due to
complexity of video data and lack of annotations. Previous convolutional neural
networks (CNN) based video action detection approaches usually consist of two
major steps: frame-level action proposal detection and association of proposals
across frames. Also, these methods employ two-stream CNN framework to handle
spatial and temporal feature separately. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end deep network called Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for
action detection in videos. The proposed architecture is a unified network that
is able to recognize and localize action based on 3D convolution features. A
video is first divided into equal length clips and for each clip a set of tube
proposals are generated next based on 3D Convolutional Network (ConvNet)
features. Finally, the tube proposals of different clips are linked together
employing network flow and spatio-temporal action detection is performed using
these linked video proposals. Extensive experiments on several video datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of T-CNN for classifying and localizing
actions in both trimmed and untrimmed videos compared to state-of-the-arts.

Title: Video and Accelerometer-Based Motion Analysis for Automated Surgical Skills Assessment

Abstract: Purpose: Basic surgical skills of suturing and knot tying are an essential part of medical training. Having an automated system for surgical skills assessment could help save experts time and improve training efficiency. There have been some recent attempts at automated surgical skills assessment using either video analysis or acceleration data. In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated assessment of OSATS based surgical skills and provide an analysis of different features on multi-modal data (video and accelerometer data). Methods: We conduct the largest study, to the best of our knowledge, for basic surgical skills assessment on a dataset that contained video and accelerometer data for suturing and knot-tying tasks. We introduce ""entropy based"" features - Approximate Entropy (ApEn) and Cross-Approximate Entropy (XApEn), which quantify the amount of predictability and regularity of fluctuations in time-series data. The proposed features are compared to existing methods of Sequential Motion Texture (SMT), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), for surgical skills assessment. Results: We report average performance of different features across all applicable OSATS criteria for suturing and knot tying tasks. Our analysis shows that the proposed entropy based features out-perform previous state-of-the-art methods using video data. For accelerometer data, our method performs better for suturing only. We also show that fusion of video and acceleration features can improve overall performance with the proposed entropy features achieving highest accuracy. Conclusions: Automated surgical skills assessment can be achieved with high accuracy using the proposed entropy features. Such a system can significantly improve the efficiency of surgical training in medical schools and teaching hospitals.",0.37070668

What evidence suggests the timescale over which star formation occurs within individual gas spurs?,d298210e,"Title: The PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS). The Role of Spiral Arms in Cloud and Star Formation

observed along prominent spiral arms remains elusive. We present results of a
multi-wavelength study of a spiral arm segment in the nearby grand-design
spiral galaxy M51 that belongs to a spiral density wave and exhibits nine gas
spurs. The combined observations of the(ionized, atomic, molecular, dusty)
interstellar medium (ISM) with star formation tracers (HII regions, young
<10Myr stellar clusters) suggest (1) no variation in giant molecular cloud
(GMC) properties between arm and gas spurs, (2) gas spurs and extinction
feathers arising from the same structure with a close spatial relation between
gas spurs and ongoing/recent star formation (despite higher gas surface
densities in the spiral arm), (3) no trend in star formation age either along
the arm or along a spur, (4) evidence for strong star formation feedback in gas
spurs: (5) tentative evidence for star formation triggered by stellar feedback
for one spur, and (6) GMC associations (GMAs) being no special entities but the
result of blending of gas arm/spur cross-sections in lower resolution
observations. We conclude that there is no evidence for a coherent star
formation onset mechanism that can be solely associated to the presence of the
spiral density wave. This suggests that other (more localized) mechanisms are
important to delay star formation such that it occurs in spurs. The evidence of
star formation proceeding over several million years within individual spurs
implies that the mechanism that leads to star formation acts or is sustained
over a longer time-scale.

The article also discusses the scaling of the computational effort with the number of degrees of freedom and potential further improvements to this approach.

While this article does not provide a direct answer to the question about the limitations of using Gaussian process regression for minimum energy path calculations as the number of degrees of freedom increases, it suggests that the approach can be computationally efficient, especially for problems with a small number of degrees of freedom. As the number of degrees of freedom increases, the computational effort may also increase, and further adjustments to the approach may be necessary to maintain its efficiency.

        Abstract:   The statistical behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue has important
implications for systems which can be modeled using a Wishart-Laguerre
ensemble, the regular one or the fixed trace one. For example, the density of
the smallest eigenvalue of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble plays a crucial role
in characterizing multiple channel telecommunication systems. Similarly, in the
quantum entanglement problem, the smallest eigenvalue of the fixed trace
ensemble carries information regarding the nature of entanglement.
For real Wishart-Laguerre matrices, there exists an elegant recurrence scheme
suggested by Edelman to directly obtain the exact expression for the smallest
eigenvalue density. In the case of complex Wishart-Laguerre matrices, for
finding exact and explicit expressions for the smallest eigenvalue density,
existing results based on determinants become impractical when the determinants
involve large-size matrices. In this work, we derive a recurrence scheme for
the complex case which is analogous to that of Edelman's for the real case.
This is used to obtain exact results for the smallest eigenvalue density for
both the regular, and the fixed trace complex Wishart-Laguerre ensembles. We
validate our analytical results using Monte Carlo simulations. We also study
scaled Wishart-Laguerre ensemble and investigate its efficacy in approximating
the fixed-trace ensemble. Eventually, we apply our result for the fixed-trace
ensemble to investigate the behaviour of the smallest eigenvalue in the
paradigmatic system of coupled kicked tops.

What are some novel methods for sound localization in indoor environments when the sound source is not directly visible?,2ad12bfa,"Title: Diffraction-Aware Sound Localization for a Non-Line-of-Sight Source

obstacle in the scene. We combine a ray tracing based sound propagation
algorithm with a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model, which simulate
bending effects by placing a virtual sound source on a wedge in the

position of the source. Our method identifies the convergence region of those
generated acoustic rays as the estimated source position based on a particle
filter. We have evaluated our algorithm in multiple scenarios consisting of a
static and dynamic NLOS sound source. In our tested cases, our approach can
localize a source position with an average accuracy error, 0.7m, measured by
the L2 distance between estimated and actual source locations in a 7m*7m*3m

    Abstract: In this work, we apply Amplitude Modulation Spectrum (AMS) features to the source localization problem. Our approach computes 36 bilateral features for 2s long signal segments and estimates the azimuthal directions of a sound source through a binaurally trained classifier. This directional information of a sound source could be e.g. used to steer the beamformer in a hearing aid to the source of interest in order to increase the SNR. We evaluated our approach on the development set of the IEEE-AASP Challenge on sound source localization and tracking (LOCATA) and achieved a 4.25° smaller MAE than the baseline approach.

What are the empirical observations regarding the performance overhead of Kardam compared to non-Byzantine-resilient solutions?,e1e6c5dc,"Title: Asynchronous Byzantine Machine Learning (the case of SGD)

        Abstract:   Asynchronous distributed machine learning solutions have proven very
effective so far, but always assuming perfectly functioning workers. In
practice, some of the workers can however exhibit Byzantine behavior, caused by
hardware failures, software bugs, corrupt data, or even malicious attacks. We
introduce \emph{Kardam}, the first distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) algorithm that copes with Byzantine workers. Kardam consists of
two complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first
is scalar-based and ensures resilience against $\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers.
Essentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts
as a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt
the progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by
adjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme. We
prove that Kardam guarantees almost sure convergence in the presence of
asynchrony and Byzantine behavior, and we derive its convergence rate. We
evaluate Kardam on the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets and measure its overhead
with respect to non Byzantine-resilient solutions. We empirically show that
Kardam does not introduce additional noise to the learning procedure but does
induce a slowdown (the cost of Byzantine resilience) that we both theoretically
and empirically show to be less than $f/n$, where $f$ is the number of
Byzantine failures tolerated and $n$ the total number of workers.
Interestingly, we also empirically observe that the dampening component is
interesting in its own right for it enables to build an SGD algorithm that
outperforms alternative staleness-aware asynchronous competitors in
environments with honest workers.

compact topologies of the so-called SNN (Sparse Neural Network) can be achieved

models and create sparcity during training phase, instead we explicitly define
a sparse architectures of connections before the training. Building compact
neural network models is coherent with empirical observations showing that
there is much redundancy in learned neural network models. We show

How does the limited coverage of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)  affect muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay experiment?,e2ce43e5,"Title: Muon Reconstruction in the Daya Bay Water Pools

        Abstract:   Muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools would serve to verify the
simulated muon fluxes and offer the possibility of studying cosmic muons in
general. This reconstruction is, however, complicated by many optical obstacles
and the small coverage of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as compared to other
large water Cherenkov detectors. The PMTs' timing information is useful only in
the case of direct, unreflected Cherenkov light. This requires PMTs to be added
and removed as an hypothesized muon trajectory is iteratively improved, to
account for the changing effects of obstacles and direction of light.
Therefore, muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools does not lend itself
to a general fitting procedure employing smoothly varying functions with
continuous derivatives. Here, an algorithm is described which overcomes these
complications. It employs the method of Least Mean Squares to determine an
hypothesized trajectory from the PMTs' charge-weighted positions. This
initially hypothesized trajectory is then iteratively refined using the PMTs'
timing information. Reconstructions with simulated data reproduce the simulated
trajectory to within about 5 degrees in direction and about 45 cm in position
at the pool surface, with a bias that tends to pull tracks away from the

The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features. By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and text extracted via deep learning approaches.

What type of gravitational effects might arise from the mixing of large and small scale gravitational modes?,b79a4d54,"Title: Perturbation theory for cosmologies with non-linear structure

        Abstract:   The next generation of cosmological surveys will operate over unprecedented
scales, and will therefore provide exciting new opportunities for testing
general relativity. The standard method for modelling the structures that these
surveys will observe is to use cosmological perturbation theory for linear
structures on horizon-sized scales, and Newtonian gravity for non-linear
structures on much smaller scales. We propose a two-parameter formalism that
generalizes this approach, thereby allowing interactions between large and
small scales to be studied in a self-consistent and well-defined way. This uses
both post-Newtonian gravity and cosmological perturbation theory, and can be
used to model realistic cosmological scenarios including matter, radiation and
a cosmological constant. We find that the resulting field equations can be
written as a hierarchical set of perturbation equations. At leading-order,
these equations allow us to recover a standard set of Friedmann equations, as
well as a Newton-Poisson equation for the inhomogeneous part of the Newtonian
energy density in an expanding background. For the perturbations in the
large-scale cosmology, however, we find that the field equations are sourced by
both non-linear and mode-mixing terms, due to the existence of small-scale
structures. These extra terms should be expected to give rise to new
gravitational effects, through the mixing of gravitational modes on small and
large scales - effects that are beyond the scope of standard linear
cosmological perturbation theory. We expect our formalism to be useful for
accurately modelling gravitational physics in universes that contain non-linear
structures, and for investigating the effects of non-linear gravity in the era

What is the relationship between stellar mass surface density and the ages of sub-galactic regions in spirals?,57ddba54,"Title: Resolving the age bimodality of galaxy stellar populations on kpc scales

        Abstract:   Galaxies in the local Universe are known to follow bimodal distributions in

on ~1-kpc scales in a volume-corrected sample of 394 galaxies, drawn from the
CALIFA-DR3 integral-field-spectroscopy survey and complemented by SDSS imaging.
We find a bimodal local-age distribution, with an old and a young peak
primarily due to regions in early-type galaxies and star-forming regions of
spirals, respectively. Within spiral galaxies, the older ages of bulges and
inter-arm regions relative to spiral arms support an internal age bimodality.
Although regions of higher stellar-mass surface-density, mu*, are typically
older, mu* alone does not determine the stellar population age and a bimodal
distribution is found at any fixed mu*. We identify an ""old ridge"" of regions
of age ~9 Gyr, independent of mu*, and a ""young sequence"" of regions with age
increasing with mu* from 1-1.5 Gyr to 4-5 Gyr. We interpret the former as
regions containing only old stars, and the latter as regions where the relative
contamination of old stellar populations by young stars decreases as mu*
increases. The reason why this bimodal age distribution is not inconsistent
with the unimodal shape of the cosmic-averaged star-formation history is that
i) the dominating contribution by young stars biases the age low with respect
to the average epoch of star formation, and ii) the use of a single average age
per region is unable to represent the full time-extent of the star-formation
history of ""young-sequence"" regions.
","Title: Resolving the age bimodality of galaxy stellar populations on kpc scales

Abstract: Galaxies in the local Universe are known to follow bimodal distributions in the global stellar populations properties. We analyze the distribution of the local average stellar-population ages of 654,053 sub-galactic regions resolved on ~1-kpc scales in a volume-corrected sample of 394 galaxies, drawn from the CALIFA-DR3 integral-field-spectroscopy survey and complemented by SDSS imaging. We find a bimodal local-age distribution, with an old and a young peak primarily due to regions in early-type galaxies and star-forming regions of spirals, respectively. Within spiral galaxies, the older ages of bulges and inter-arm regions relative to spiral arms support an internal age bimodality. 

According to this study, there is no direct relationship between stellar mass surface density (`mu*`) and the ages of sub-galactic regions in spirals. In fact, the study finds that at any fixed `mu*`, a bimodal distribution is still present, suggesting that `mu*` alone does not determine the stellar population age. The study does, however, identify an ""old ridge"" of regions with an age of ~9 Gyr, independent of `mu*`, and a ""young sequence"" of regions with age increasing with `mu*` from 1-1.5 Gyr to 4-5 Gyr. This suggests that the age of sub-galactic regions in spirals may be influenced by other factors beyond just stellar mass surface density.",0.9185583

Describe the characteristics of the set of pushes used for fixtureless fixturing.,737f6d89,"Title: Regrasping by Fixtureless Fixturing

        Abstract:   This paper presents a fixturing strategy for regrasping that does not require
a physical fixture. To regrasp an object in a gripper, a robot pushes the
object against external contact/s in the environment such that the external
contact keeps the object stationary while the fingers slide over the object. We
call this manipulation technique fixtureless fixturing. Exploiting the
mechanics of pushing, we characterize a convex polyhedral set of pushes that
results in fixtureless fixturing. These pushes are robust against uncertainty
in the object inertia, grasping force, and the friction at the contacts. We
propose a sampling-based planner that uses the sets of robust pushes to rapidly
build a tree of reachable grasps. A path in this tree is a pushing strategy,
possibly involving pushes from different sides, to regrasp the object. We
demonstrate the experimental validity and robustness of the proposed
manipulation technique with different regrasp examples on a manipulation
platform. Such a fast and flexible regrasp planner facilitates versatile and
flexible automation solutions.

How do Weyl fermion quasiparticles and Fermi arc states change with the bulk band topology of Weyl semimetals?,1f130626,"Title: Distinct evolutions of Weyl fermion quasiparticles and Fermi arcs with bulk band topology in Weyl semimetals

        Abstract:   The Weyl semimetal phase is a recently discovered topological quantum state
of matter characterized by the presence of topologically protected degeneracies
near the Fermi level. These degeneracies are the source of exotic phenomena,
including the realization of chiral Weyl fermions as quasiparticles in the bulk
and the formation of Fermi arc states on the surfaces. Here, we demonstrate
that these two key signatures show distinct evolutions with the bulk band
topology by performing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by
first-principle calculations, on transition-metal monophosphides. While Weyl
fermion quasiparticles exist only when the chemical potential is located
between two saddle points of the Weyl cone features, the Fermi arc states
extend in a larger energy scale and are robust across the bulk Lifshitz
transitions associated with the recombination of two non-trivial Fermi surfaces
enclosing one Weyl point into a single trivial Fermi surface enclosing two Weyl
points of opposite chirality. Therefore, in some systems (e.g. NbP),
topological Fermi arc states are preserved even if Weyl fermion quasiparticles
are absent in the bulk. Our findings not only provide insight into the
relationship between the exotic physical phenomena and the intrinsic bulk band
topology in Weyl semimetals, but also resolve the apparent puzzle of the
different magneto-transport properties observed in TaAs, TaP and NbP, where the
Fermi arc states are similar.

What are the consequences of using inappropriate prior probabilities in uncertainty propagation?,1705deba,"Title: The effect of prior probabilities on quantification and propagation of imprecise probabilities resulting from small datasets

        Abstract:   This paper outlines a methodology for Bayesian multimodel uncertainty
quantification (UQ) and propagation and presents an investigation into the
effect of prior probabilities on the resulting uncertainties. The UQ
methodology is adapted from the information-theoretic method previously
presented by the authors (Zhang and Shields, 2018) to a fully Bayesian
construction that enables greater flexibility in quantifying uncertainty in
probability model form. Being Bayesian in nature and rooted in UQ from small
datasets, prior probabilities in both probability model form and model
parameters are shown to have a significant impact on quantified uncertainties
and, consequently, on the uncertainties propagated through a physics-based
model. These effects are specifically investigated for a simplified plate
buckling problem with uncertainties in material properties derived from a small
number of experiments using noninformative priors and priors derived from past
studies of varying appropriateness. It is illustrated that prior probabilities
can have a significant impact on multimodel UQ for small datasets and
inappropriate (but seemingly reasonable) priors may even have lingering effects
that bias probabilities even for large datasets. When applied to uncertainty
propagation, this may result in probability bounds on response quantities that
do not include the true probabilities.
","A researcher looking for papers on the consequences of using inappropriate prior probabilities in uncertainty propagation! Let me help you find the answers.

According to the papers, when applied to uncertainty propagation, the effects of using inappropriate prior probabilities can be significant. For instance, in the paper ""The effect of prior probabilities on quantification and propagation of imprecise probabilities resulting from small datasets"", it is illustrated that prior probabilities can have a significant impact on multimodel UQ for small datasets. In fact, even when using large datasets, inappropriate but seemingly reasonable priors can still have lingering effects that bias probabilities. This may result in probability bounds on response quantities that do not include the true probabilities.

In the paper ""Improper posteriors are not improper"", it is explained that under certain conditions, improper priors can be allowed when using the theory of Renyi. This contradicts the classical notion that improper priors lead to improper posteriors. The authors investigate the marginalization paradoxes that arise from this and explain the seemingly conflicting results.

Recent studies have reported that water purifications systems are responsible
for huge contributions to human capital. Although a few studies have
investigated the short-term effects of water-supply systems in pre-war Japan,
little is known about the benefits associated with these systems. By analyzing
city-level cause-specific mortality data from the years 1922-1940, we found
that eliminating typhoid fever infections decreased the risk of deaths due to
non-waterborne diseases. Our estimates show that for one additional typhoid
death, there were approximately one to three deaths due to other causes, such
as tuberculosis and pneumonia. This suggests that the observed Mills-Reincke
phenomenon could have resulted from the prevention typhoid fever in a
previously-developing Asian country.

Title: Playing Atari with Six Neurons

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning on Atari games maps pixel directly to actions; internally, the deep neural network bears the responsibility of both extracting useful information and making decisions based on it. Aiming at devoting entire deep networks to decision making alone, we propose a new method for learning policies and compact state representations separately but simultaneously for policy approximation in reinforcement learning. State representations are generated by a novel algorithm based on Vector Quantization and Sparse Coding, trained online along with the network, and capable of growing its dictionary size over time. We also introduce new techniques allowing both the neural network and the evolution strategy to cope with varying dimensions. This enables networks of only 6 to 18 neurons to learn to play a selection of Atari games with performance comparable---and occasionally superior---to state-of-the-art techniques using evolution strategies on deep networks two orders of magnitude larger.

This paper introduces a new method for learning policies and state representations separately, which could potentially improve the efficiency of traditional algorithms in certain domains.

the convergence rate by a constant factor, the linear minimization step can be
a fraction of the cost of that of the deterministic versions, especially when

"Why do architectures with skip connections, like highway networks and resnets, outperform standard feedforward networks even with optimal initialization and batch normalization?",bb1aa03c,"Title: The Shattered Gradients Problem: If resnets are the answer, then what is the question?

        Abstract:   A long-standing obstacle to progress in deep learning is the problem of
vanishing and exploding gradients. Although, the problem has largely been
overcome via carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization,
architectures incorporating skip-connections such as highway and resnets
perform much better than standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen
initialization and batch normalization. In this paper, we identify the
shattered gradients problem. Specifically, we show that the correlation between
gradients in standard feedforward networks decays exponentially with depth
resulting in gradients that resemble white noise whereas, in contrast, the
gradients in architectures with skip-connections are far more resistant to
shattering, decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in
support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets.
Finally, we present a new ""looks linear"" (LL) initialization that prevents
shattering, with preliminary experiments showing the new initialization allows
to train very deep networks without the addition of skip-connections.
","I couldn't find any direct connection between the research papers you provided and the topic you're asking about. The papers are from different domains and don't explicitly discuss architectures with skip connections, like highway networks and ResNets.

However, I can suggest some possible reasons why architectures with skip connections might outperform standard feedforward networks. This finding has been observed in the context of deep neural networks, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

One possible explanation is that skip connections allow the network to learn more accurate and robust representations of the input data by bypassing the multiple layers of the network and reducing the risk of vanishing gradients. This is particularly important in deep neural networks, where the gradients can become very small as they propagate through the layers, making it difficult for the network to learn complex representations.

Another possible reason is that skip connections can help to address the problem of gradient explosions, which occurs when the gradients become very large and destroy the optimization process. By skipping some layers, the network can reduce the effect of these gradients and stabilize the optimization process.

Yet another possible reason is that skip connections can help to improve the ability of the network to learn long-term dependencies in the data by allowing the network to capture more complex relationships between different parts of the input data.

Again, these are just some possible explanations, and the actual reasons for the outperformance of architectures with skip connections may be more complex and dependent on the specific task and dataset used.

It seems that none of the provided papers directly address this topic. If you're looking for research on this topic, you may want to search for papers that specifically discuss architectures with skip connections, such as ResNets or highway networks, and their performance in various tasks.",0.38175285
Why is a standard fitting procedure with continuous derivatives not suitable for muon reconstruction in Daya Bay?,e2ce43e5,"Title: Muon Reconstruction in the Daya Bay Water Pools

        Abstract:   Muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools would serve to verify the
simulated muon fluxes and offer the possibility of studying cosmic muons in
general. This reconstruction is, however, complicated by many optical obstacles
and the small coverage of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as compared to other
large water Cherenkov detectors. The PMTs' timing information is useful only in
the case of direct, unreflected Cherenkov light. This requires PMTs to be added
and removed as an hypothesized muon trajectory is iteratively improved, to
account for the changing effects of obstacles and direction of light.
Therefore, muon reconstruction in the Daya Bay water pools does not lend itself
to a general fitting procedure employing smoothly varying functions with
continuous derivatives. Here, an algorithm is described which overcomes these
complications. It employs the method of Least Mean Squares to determine an
hypothesized trajectory from the PMTs' charge-weighted positions. This
initially hypothesized trajectory is then iteratively refined using the PMTs'
timing information. Reconstructions with simulated data reproduce the simulated
trajectory to within about 5 degrees in direction and about 45 cm in position
at the pool surface, with a bias that tends to pull tracks away from the
vertical by about 3 degrees.

The most well-motivated modification of gravity proposed as an alternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND), and we present here the first ever N-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a realistic baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we attempt to reproduce the present-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf and its immense tidal stream that wraps around the Milky Way. With very little freedom on the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total luminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size relation for isolated dwarf galaxies, we find reasonable agreement between our simulations and observations of this system.

N-body simulations refer to a type of computer simulation used to study the behavior of a system consisting of many interacting particles (in this case, stars and other particles in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy). They were used to study the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy by simulating the dynamical evolution of the disrupting galaxy in the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), which is a modification of gravity that is an alternative to dark matter on galactic scales. The simulations attempted to reproduce the present-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and its tidal stream, which wraps around the Milky Way.",0.9400886

What are the limitations of traditional anomaly detection methods in cloud computing?,91b2eca7,"Title: Anomaly detecting and ranking of the cloud computing platform by multi-view learning

        Abstract:   Anomaly detecting as an important technical in cloud computing is applied to
support smooth running of the cloud platform. Traditional detecting methods
based on statistic, analysis, etc. lead to the high false-alarm rate due to
non-adaptive and sensitive parameters setting. We presented an online model for
anomaly detecting using machine learning theory. However, most existing methods
based on machine learning linked all features from difference sub-systems into
a long feature vector directly, which is difficult to both exploit the
complement information between sub-systems and ignore multi-view features
enhancing the classification performance. Aiming to this problem, the proposed
method automatic fuses multi-view features and optimize the discriminative
model to enhance the accuracy. This model takes advantage of extreme learning
machine (ELM) to improve detection efficiency. ELM is the single hidden layer
neural network, which is transforming iterative solution the output weights to
solution of linear equations and avoiding the local optimal solution. Moreover,
we rank anomies according to the relationship between samples and the
classification boundary, and then assigning weights for ranked anomalies,
retraining the classification model finally. Our method exploits the complement
information between sub-systems sufficiently, and avoids the influence from
imbalance dataset, therefore, deal with various challenges from the cloud
computing platform. We deploy the privately cloud platform by Openstack,
verifying the proposed model and comparing results to the state-of-the-art
methods with better efficiency and simplicity.
","What a delightful challenge!

How was the change in color of WD1145+017 during transits measured?,9bc0b2c8,"Title: Once in a blue moon: detection of 'bluing' during debris transits in the white dwarf WD1145+017

        Abstract:   The first transiting planetesimal orbiting a white dwarf was recently
detected in K2 data of WD1145+017 and has been followed up intensively. The
multiple, long, and variable transits suggest the transiting objects are dust
clouds, probably produced by a disintegrating asteroid. In addition, the system
contains circumstellar gas, evident by broad absorption lines, mostly in the
u'-band, and a dust disc, indicated by an infrared excess. Here we present the
first detection of a change in colour of WD1145+017 during transits, using
simultaneous multi-band fast-photometry ULTRACAM measurements over the
u'g'r'i'-bands. The observations reveal what appears to be 'bluing' during
transits; transits are deeper in the redder bands, with a u'-r' colour
difference of up to ~-0.05 mag. We explore various possible explanations for
the bluing. 'Spectral' photometry obtained by integrating over bandpasses in
the spectroscopic data in- and out-of-transit, compared to the photometric
data, shows that the observed colour difference is most likely the result of
reduced circumstellar absorption in the spectrum during transits. This
indicates that the transiting objects and the gas share the same line-of-sight,
and that the gas covers the white dwarf only partially, as would be expected if
the gas, the transiting debris, and the dust emitting the infrared excess, are
part of the same general disc structure (although possibly at different radii).
In addition, we present the results of a week-long monitoring campaign of the
system.

existing techniques for computing GED are only able to process very small

systematically study the problems of both GED computation, and GED verification

threshold). Firstly, we develop a unified framework that can be instantiated
into either a best-first search approach AStar+ or a depth-first search

techniques to compute tighter lower bounds for intermediate search states,
which significantly reduce the search spaces of both AStar+ and DFS+. We also
propose efficient techniques to compute the lower bounds. Thirdly, based on our
unified framework, we contrast AStar+ with DFS+ regarding their time and space
complexities, and recommend that AStar+ is better than DFS+ by having a much
smaller search space. Extensive empirical studies validate that AStar+ performs
better than DFS+, and show that our AStar+-BMa approach outperforms the

Can you provide an example of an application where fully Bayesian estimation is used in conjunction with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey?,dc837bc0,"Title: Fully Bayesian Estimation Under Informative Sampling

        Abstract:   Bayesian estimation is increasingly popular for performing model based
inference to support policymaking. These data are often collected from surveys
under informative sampling designs where subject inclusion probabilities are
designed to be correlated with the response variable of interest. Sampling
weights constructed from marginal inclusion probabilities are typically used to
form an exponentiated pseudo likelihood that adjusts the population likelihood
for estimation on the sample due to ease-of-estimation. We propose an
alternative adjustment based on a Bayes rule construction that simultaneously
performs weight smoothing and estimates the population model parameters in a
fully Bayesian construction. We formulate conditions on known marginal and
pairwise inclusion probabilities that define a class of sampling designs where
$L_{1}$ consistency of the joint posterior is guaranteed. We compare
performances between the two approaches on synthetic data, which reveals that
our fully Bayesian approach better estimates posterior uncertainty without a
requirement to calibrate the normalization of the sampling weights. We
demonstrate our method on an application concerning the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey exploring the relationship between caffeine

observations at high angular resolution are also presented for two sources.

As a consequence, the phase velocities of electromagnetic waves possessing orthogonal polarizations do not coincide, thus displaying the birefringence effect. Two electromagnetic field configurations are studied in detail: longitudinal and transversal with respect to the aether pp-wave front. For both cases the solutions are found, which reveal anomalies in the electromagnetic response on the action of the pp-wave aether mode.",1.0

What type of approximation is used to address the intractability of the conditioned hazard/propensity function for Markov jump processes?,a87f2385,"Title: Efficient sampling of conditioned Markov jump processes

        Abstract:   We consider the task of generating draws from a Markov jump process (MJP)
between two time points at which the process is known. Resulting draws are
typically termed bridges and the generation of such bridges plays a key role in
simulation-based inference algorithms for MJPs. The problem is challenging due
to the intractability of the conditioned process, necessitating the use of
computationally intensive methods such as weighted resampling or Markov chain
Monte Carlo. An efficient implementation of such schemes requires an
approximation of the intractable conditioned hazard/propensity function that is
both cheap and accurate. In this paper, we review some existing approaches to
this problem before outlining our novel contribution. Essentially, we leverage
the tractability of a Gaussian approximation of the MJP and suggest a
computationally efficient implementation of the resulting conditioned hazard
approximation. We compare and contrast our approach with existing methods using

How does the concept of 'mindless mathematical laws' clash with certain interpretations of the universe?,2ad242b7,"Title: From mindless mathematics to thinking meat?

        Abstract:   Deconstruction of the theme of the 2017 FQXi essay contest is already an
interesting exercise in its own right: Teleology is rarely useful in physics
--- the only known mainstream physics example (black hole event horizons) has a
very mixed score-card --- so the ""goals"" and ""aims and intentions"" alluded to
in the theme of the 2017 FQXi essay contest are already somewhat pushing the
limits. Furthermore, ""aims and intentions"" certainly carries the implication of
consciousness, and opens up a whole can of worms related to the mind-body
problem. As for ""mindless mathematical laws"", that allusion is certainly in
tension with at least some versions of the ""mathematical universe hypothesis"".
Finally ""wandering towards a goal"" again carries the implication of
consciousness, with all its attendant problems.
In this essay I will argue, simply because we do not yet have any really good
mathematical or physical theory of consciousness, that the theme of this essay
contest is premature, and unlikely to lead to any resolution that would be
widely accepted in the mathematics or physics communities.
","What an intriguing set of research papers! After scouring through the abstracts, I found a relevant connection to your question.

The title that seems to address the concept of 'mindless mathematical laws' is: ""Perturbation theory for cosmologies with non-linear structure"".

Abstract: The standard method for modelling the structures that next-generation cosmological surveys will observe is to use cosmological perturbation theory for linear structures on horizon-sized scales, and Newtonian gravity for non-linear structures on much smaller scales. [The authors propose a] two-parameter formalism that generalizes this approach, allowing interactions between large and small scales to be studied in a self-consistent and well-defined way.

In this paper, the concept of 'mindless mathematical laws' might clash with certain interpretations of the universe because the authors are exploring the idea of non-linear structures in cosmology, which could imply a more complex, non-deterministic relationship between space, time, and matter. This could potentially challenge the notion of 'mindless mathematical laws' if these laws are not sufficient to explain the behavior of non-linear structures.

Keep in mind that this is just a connection I found, and the authors may not have explicitly addressed the concept of 'mindless mathematical laws' in their work.",0.5711427
How do discontinuous mappings affect the analysis of latent space dimensions for set function representation?,5384ba59,"Title: On the Limitations of Representing Functions on Sets

        Abstract:   Recent work on the representation of functions on sets has considered the use
of summation in a latent space to enforce permutation invariance. In
particular, it has been conjectured that the dimension of this latent space may
remain fixed as the cardinality of the sets under consideration increases.
However, we demonstrate that the analysis leading to this conjecture requires
mappings which are highly discontinuous and argue that this is only of limited
practical use. Motivated by this observation, we prove that an implementation
of this model via continuous mappings (as provided by e.g. neural networks or
Gaussian processes) actually imposes a constraint on the dimensionality of the
latent space. Practical universal function representation for set inputs can
only be achieved with a latent dimension at least the size of the maximum
number of input elements.

ensuring safe operation and stable power supply even when certain faults occur.
No matter such faults are caused by vulnerabilities of system components,
physical attacks, or cyber-attacks that are more related to cyber-security,
they eventually affect the physical stability of a power system. Examples of
the loss of physical stability include the Northeast blackout of 2003 in North
America and the 2015 system-wide blackout in Ukraine. The nonlinear hybrid
nature, that is, nonlinear continuous dynamics integrated with discrete
switching, and the high degree of freedom property of power system dynamics
make it challenging to conduct the dynamic security analysis. In this paper, we
use the hybrid automaton model to describe the dynamics of a power system and
mainly deal with the index-1 differential-algebraic equation models regarding
the continuous dynamics in different discrete states. The analysis problem is
formulated as a reachability problem of the associated hybrid model. A
sampling-based algorithm is then proposed by integrating modeling and
randomized simulation of the hybrid dynamics to search for a feasible execution
connecting an initial state of the post-fault system and a target set in the
desired operation mode. The proposed method enables the use of existing power
system simulators for the synthesis of discrete switching and control
strategies through randomized simulation. The effectiveness and performance of
the proposed approach are demonstrated with an application to the dynamic
security analysis of the New England 39-bus benchmark power system exhibiting
hybrid dynamics. In addition to evaluating the dynamic security, the proposed
method searches for a feasible strategy to ensure the dynamic security of the

What are the state-of-the-art results achieved by SNTG on benchmark datasets for semi-supervised learning?,a0b9ee23,"Title: Smooth Neighbors on Teacher Graphs for Semi-supervised Learning

unlabeled data under different perturbations. However, they only consider
adding perturbations to each single data point, while ignoring the connections
between data samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called Smooth
Neighbors on Teacher Graphs (SNTG). In SNTG, a graph is constructed based on
the predictions of the teacher model, i.e., the implicit self-ensemble of

What is a lattice Boltzmann method used for in studying the heat transfer of a phase change material within metal foams?,cc4e1a59,"Title: An enthalpy-based multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method for solid-liquid phase change heat transfer in metal foams

        Abstract:   In this paper, an enthalpy-based multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice
Boltzmann (LB) method is developed for solid-liquid phase change heat transfer
in metal foams under local thermal non-equilibrium (LTNE) condition. The
enthalpy-based MRT-LB method consists of three different MRT-LB models: one for
flow field based on the generalized non-Darcy model, and the other two for
phase change material (PCM) and metal foam temperature fields described by the
LTNE model. The moving solid-liquid phase interface is implicitly tracked
through the liquid fraction, which is simultaneously obtained when the energy
equations of PCM and metal foam are solved. The present method has several
distinctive features. First, as compared with previous studies, the present
method avoids the iteration procedure, thus it retains the inherent merits of
the standard LB method and is superior over the iteration method in terms of
accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, a volumetric LB scheme instead
of the bounce-back scheme is employed to realize the no-slip velocity condition
in the interface and solid phase regions, which is consistent with the actual
situation. Last but not least, the MRT collision model is employed, and with
additional degrees of freedom, it has the ability to reduce the numerical
diffusion across phase interface induced by solid-liquid phase change.
Numerical tests demonstrate that the present method can be served as an
accurate and efficient numerical tool for studying metal foam enhanced
solid-liquid phase change heat transfer in latent heat storage. Finally,
comparisons and discussions are made to offer useful information for practical
applications of the present method.

identifying fixed and random effects. From a statistical point of view, it
remains to test the nullity of the variances of a given subset of random
effects. Some authors have proposed to use the likelihood ratio test and have
established its asymptotic distribution in some particular cases. Nevertheless,
to the best of our knowledge, no general variance components testing procedure
has been fully investigated yet. In this paper, we study the likelihood ratio
test properties to test that the variances of a general subset of the random
effects are equal to zero in both linear and nonlinear mixed effects model,

the test is a chi-bar-square distribution, that is to say a mixture of
chi-square distributions, and we identify the corresponding weights. We
highlight in particular that the limiting distribution depends on the presence
of correlations between the random effects but not on the linear or nonlinear

properties of the test procedure through simulation studies and apply the test

        Abstract:   The amount of ultraviolet irradiation and ablation experienced by a planet
depends strongly on the temperature of its host star. Of the thousands of
extra-solar planets now known, only four giant planets have been found that
transit hot, A-type stars (temperatures of 7300-10,000K), and none are known to
transit even hotter B-type stars. WASP-33 is an A-type star with a temperature
of ~7430K, which hosts the hottest known transiting planet; the planet is
itself as hot as a red dwarf star of type M. The planet displays a large heat
differential between its day-side and night-side, and is highly inflated,
traits that have been linked to high insolation. However, even at the
temperature of WASP-33b's day-side, its atmosphere likely resembles the
molecule-dominated atmospheres of other planets, and at the level of
ultraviolet irradiation it experiences, its atmosphere is unlikely to be
significantly ablated over the lifetime of its star. Here we report
observations of the bright star HD 195689, which reveal a close-in (orbital
period ~1.48 days) transiting giant planet, KELT-9b. At ~10,170K, the host star
is at the dividing line between stars of type A and B, and we measure the
KELT-9b's day-side temperature to be ~4600K. This is as hot as stars of stellar
type K4. The molecules in K stars are entirely dissociated, and thus the
primary sources of opacity in the day-side atmosphere of KELT-9b are likely
atomic metals. Furthermore, KELT-9b receives ~700 times more extreme
ultraviolet radiation (wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers) than WASP-33b,
leading to a predicted range of mass-loss rates that could leave the planet
largely stripped of its envelope during the main-sequence lifetime of the host
star.

constituents that exhibit counteracting effects on their equilibrium. In this

notion, but not both. We postulate that these systems attempt to regulate the
state vector of their constituents such that both the kinetic and the energetic
notions of equilibrium are met. Based on this postulate, we prove: 1) the
existence of a point such that the kinetic notion of equilibrium is met for the
less abundant constituents and, at the same time, the state vector of more
abundant entities is regulated to minimize the energetic notion of equilibrium;
2) the effect of unboundedly increasing less (more) abundant constituents
stabilizes (destabilizes) the system; and 3) the (unrestricted) equilibrium of
the system is the point at which the number of stabilizing and destabilizing
entities increase unboundedly with the same rate.

Non-spatial models and traditional spatial mixed-effects models each have their advantages and disadvantages, making it difficult for practitioners to determine how to carry out a spatial regression analysis. We discuss the data-generating mechanisms implicitly assumed by various popular spatial regression models, and discuss the implications of these assumptions. We propose Bayesian spatial filtering as an approximate middle way between non-spatial models and traditional spatial mixed models. We show by simulation that our Bayesian spatial filtering model has several desirable properties and hence may be a useful addition to a spatial statistician's toolkit.",0.9407258
How does the extension complexity of the stable set polytope of a bipartite graph relate to the number of vertices and edges in the graph?,d34ea03d,"Title: Extension complexity of stable set polytopes of bipartite graphs

        Abstract:   The extension complexity $\mathsf{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$ is the minimum
number of facets of a polytope that affinely projects to $P$. Let $G$ be a
bipartite graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and no isolated vertices. Let
$\mathsf{STAB}(G)$ be the convex hull of the stable sets of $G$. It is easy to
see that $n \leqslant \mathsf{xc} (\mathsf{STAB}(G)) \leqslant n+m$. We improve
both of these bounds. For the upper bound, we show that $\mathsf{xc}
(\mathsf{STAB}(G))$ is $O(\frac{n^2}{\log n})$, which is an improvement when
$G$ has quadratically many edges. For the lower bound, we prove that
$\mathsf{xc} (\mathsf{STAB}(G))$ is $\Omega(n \log n)$ when $G$ is the
incidence graph of a finite projective plane. We also provide examples of
$3$-regular bipartite graphs $G$ such that the edge vs stable set matrix of $G$
has a fooling set of size $|E(G)|$.

        Abstract:   Tidal streams of disrupting dwarf galaxies orbiting around their host galaxy
offer a unique way to constrain the shape of galactic gravitational potentials.
Such streams can be used as leaning tower gravitational experiments on galactic
scales. The most well motivated modification of gravity proposed as an
alternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND),

evolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a

on the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total
luminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size

law, exact periodic and solitonic solutions exist. Khare and Saxena

solutions by combining known ones for several fundamental equations (e.g.,
Korteweg - de Vries, Nonlinear Schrödinger). Here we find that this

How does the introduction of a new species  with a fast-redshifting energy density affect dark matter freeze-out temperatures?,161a67da,"Title: When the Universe Expands Too Fast: Relentless Dark Matter

        Abstract:   We consider a modification to the standard cosmological history consisting of
introducing a new species $\phi$ whose energy density red-shifts with the scale
factor $a$ like $\rho_\phi \propto a^{-(4+n)}$. For $n>0$, such a red-shift is
faster than radiation, hence the new species dominates the energy budget of the
universe at early times while it is completely negligible at late times. If
equality with the radiation energy density is achieved at low enough
temperatures, dark matter can be produced as a thermal relic during the new
cosmological phase. Dark matter freeze-out then occurs at higher temperatures
compared to the standard case, implying that reproducing the observed abundance
requires significantly larger annihilation rates. Here, we point out a
completely new phenomenon, which we refer to as $\textit{relentless}$ dark
matter: for large enough $n$, unlike the standard case where annihilation ends
shortly after the departure from thermal equilibrium, dark matter particles
keep annihilating long after leaving chemical equilibrium, with a significant
depletion of the final relic abundance. Relentless annihilation occurs for $n
\geq 2$ and $n \geq 4$ for s-wave and p-wave annihilation, respectively, and it
thus occurs in well motivated scenarios such as a quintessence with a kination
phase. We discuss a few microscopic realizations for the new cosmological

Title: Mixing of odd- and even-frequency pairings in strongly correlated electron systems under magnetic field

Abstract: Even- and odd-frequency superconductivity coexist due to broken time-reversal symmetry under magnetic field. In order to describe this mixing, we extend the linearized Eliashberg equation for the spin and charge fluctuation mechanism in strongly correlated electron systems. We apply this extended Eliashberg equation to the odd-frequency superconductivity on a quasi-one-dimensional isosceles triangular lattice under in-plane magnetic field and examine the effect of the even-frequency component.

This paper explains how the Eliashberg equation is extended to describe the mixing of odd- and even-frequency pairings in strongly correlated electron systems under magnetic field. The equation is applied to a specific system, revealing the interplay between spin and charge fluctuations and their effect on superconductivity.",0.90098554
What are the advantages of  the proposed approach for network pruning compared to baseline methods? ,0ac14a18,"Title: Attention-Based Guided Structured Sparsity of Deep Neural Networks

        Abstract:   Network pruning is aimed at imposing sparsity in a neural network
architecture by increasing the portion of zero-valued weights for reducing its
size regarding energy-efficiency consideration and increasing evaluation speed.
In most of the conducted research efforts, the sparsity is enforced for network
pruning without any attention to the internal network characteristics such as
unbalanced outputs of the neurons or more specifically the distribution of the
weights and outputs of the neurons. That may cause severe accuracy drop due to
uncontrolled sparsity. In this work, we propose an attention mechanism that
simultaneously controls the sparsity intensity and supervised network pruning
by keeping important information bottlenecks of the network to be active. On
CIFAR-10, the proposed method outperforms the best baseline method by 6% and
reduced the accuracy drop by 2.6x at the same level of sparsity.

How can human perception be incorporated into finding adversarial examples for machine learning models?,26fc34de,"Title: Perception-in-the-Loop Adversarial Examples

adversarial examples for deep neural network classifiers. Black box means that
our procedure only has input-output access to the classifier, and not to the
internal structure, parameters, or intermediate confidence values.
Perception-in-the-loop means that the notion of proximity between inputs can be
directly queried from human participants rather than an arbitrarily chosen
metric. Our technique is based on covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES), a black box optimization approach. CMA-ES explores the
search space iteratively in a black box manner, by generating populations of
candidates according to a distribution, choosing the best candidates according
to a cost function, and updating the posterior distribution to favor the best
candidates. We run CMA-ES using human participants to provide the fitness
function, using the insight that the choice of best candidates in CMA-ES can be
naturally modeled as a perception task: pick the top $k$ inputs perceptually
closest to a fixed input. We empirically demonstrate that finding adversarial
examples is feasible using small populations and few iterations. We compare the
performance of CMA-ES on the MNIST benchmark with other black-box approaches
using $L_p$ norms as a cost function, and show that it performs favorably both
in terms of success in finding adversarial examples and in minimizing the
distance between the original and the adversarial input. In experiments on the

perceptually similar adversarial inputs with a small number of iterations and

In what ways do traveling waves in the 'slow' diffusion setting  differ from those in the classical model and the 'pseudo-linear' case?,f17e2070,"Title: Bistable reaction equations with doubly nonlinear diffusion

        Abstract:   Reaction-diffusion equations appear in biology and chemistry, and combine
linear diffusion with different kind of reaction terms. Some of them are
remarkable from the mathematical point of view, since they admit families of
travelling waves that describe the asymptotic behaviour of a larger class of
solutions $0\leq u(x,t)\leq 1$ of the problem posed in the real line. We
investigate here the existence of waves with constant propagation speed, when
the linear diffusion is replaced by the ""slow"" doubly nonlinear diffusion. In
the present setting we consider bistable reaction terms, which present
interesting differences w.r.t. the Fisher-KPP framework recently studied in

employed to describe the wave propagation of more general solutions and to
study the stability/instability of the steady states, even when we extend the
study to several space dimensions. A similar study is performed in the critical
case that we call ""pseudo-linear"", i.e., when the operator is still nonlinear
but has homogeneity one. With respect to the classical model and the
""pseudo-linear"" case, the travelling waves of the ""slow"" diffusion setting

What is the connection between the Memory Aware Synapses (MAS) method and Hebb's rule?,5daa856c,"Title: Memory Aware Synapses: Learning what (not) to forget

        Abstract:   Humans can learn in a continuous manner. Old rarely utilized knowledge can be
overwritten by new incoming information while important, frequently used
knowledge is prevented from being erased. In artificial learning systems,
lifelong learning so far has focused mainly on accumulating knowledge over
tasks and overcoming catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we argue that,
given the limited model capacity and the unlimited new information to be
learned, knowledge has to be preserved or erased selectively. Inspired by
neuroplasticity, we propose a novel approach for lifelong learning, coined
Memory Aware Synapses (MAS). It computes the importance of the parameters of a
neural network in an unsupervised and online manner. Given a new sample which
is fed to the network, MAS accumulates an importance measure for each parameter
of the network, based on how sensitive the predicted output function is to a
change in this parameter. When learning a new task, changes to important
parameters can then be penalized, effectively preventing important knowledge
related to previous tasks from being overwritten. Further, we show an
interesting connection between a local version of our method and Hebb's
rule,which is a model for the learning process in the brain. We test our method
on a sequence of object recognition tasks and on the challenging problem of
learning an embedding for predicting $<$subject, predicate, object$>$ triplets.

identify clusters of slow particles and determine their size, $N_c$, and their
radius of gyration, $R_G$. We show that $N_c\propto R_G^{d_f}$, providing
direct evidence that the most immobile particles arrange in fractal objects
with a fractal dimension, $d_f$, that is observed to increase with packing
fraction $\phi$. The cluster size distribution obeys scaling, approaching an
algebraic decay in the limit of structural arrest, i.e., $\phi\to\phi_c$.
Alternatively, dynamical heterogeneities are analyzed via the four-point

the problems are equivalent to two optimization problems on branchings in a
derived directed acyclic graph. Building on these formulations, we obtain new
results on the two problems, including: (i) a strengthening of the heuristic by
Hujdurović et al. via a new min-max result in digraphs generalizing
Dilworth's theorem, which may be of independent interest, (ii) APX-hardness
results for both problems, (iii) approximation algorithms, and (iv)
exponential-time algorithms solving the two problems to optimality faster than
the naïve brute-force approach. Our work relates to several well studied
notions in combinatorial optimization: chain partitions in partially ordered
sets, laminar hypergraphs, and (classical and weighted) colorings of graphs.
","Based on the context, the MCRS problem relates to other concepts in combinatorial optimization like chain partitions and graph colorings as follows:

The authors mention that the problems of minimizing the number of rows in the resulting matrix (MCRS) and minimizing the number of distinct rows of the resulting matrix are related to the cocomparability graphs, which are heavily connected to the concepts of chain partitions and graph colorings.

In particular, the authors propose a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for the MCRS problem based on coloring cocomparability graphs, which is a well-studied notion in combinatorial optimization. This suggests that the MCRS problem is closely related to graph theory and combinatorial optimization.

Title: Perfect phylogenies via branchings in acyclic digraphs and a generalization of Dilworth's theorem

Abstract: Motivated by applications in cancer genomics and following the work of Hajirasouliha and Raphael (WABI 2014), Hujdurović et al. (IEEE TCBB, to appear) introduced the minimum conflict-free row split (MCRS) problem: split each row of a given binary matrix into a bitwise OR of a set of rows so that the resulting matrix corresponds to a perfect phylogeny and has the minimum possible number of rows among all matrices with this property. Hajirasouliha and Raphael also proposed the study of a similar problem, in which the task is to minimize the number of distinct rows of the resulting matrix. Hujdurović et al. proved that both problems are NP-hard, gave a related characterization of transitively orientable graphs, and proposed a polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for the MCRS problem based on coloring cocomparability graphs.",0.83400893
What are the computational challenges associated with generating draws from a conditioned Markov jump process?,a87f2385,"Title: Efficient sampling of conditioned Markov jump processes

        Abstract:   We consider the task of generating draws from a Markov jump process (MJP)
between two time points at which the process is known. Resulting draws are
typically termed bridges and the generation of such bridges plays a key role in
simulation-based inference algorithms for MJPs. The problem is challenging due
to the intractability of the conditioned process, necessitating the use of
computationally intensive methods such as weighted resampling or Markov chain
Monte Carlo. An efficient implementation of such schemes requires an
approximation of the intractable conditioned hazard/propensity function that is
both cheap and accurate. In this paper, we review some existing approaches to
this problem before outlining our novel contribution. Essentially, we leverage
the tractability of a Gaussian approximation of the MJP and suggest a
computationally efficient implementation of the resulting conditioned hazard
approximation. We compare and contrast our approach with existing methods using
three examples.

the whole plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ is proven. This particular geometry was the only
case left open since the work of Leray in 1933. The reason is that due to the
absence of boundaries the local behavior of the solutions cannot be controlled
by the enstrophy in two dimensions. We overcome this difficulty by constructing
approximate weak solutions having a prescribed mean velocity on some given
bounded set. As a corollary, we obtain infinitely many weak solutions in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ parameterized by this mean velocity, which is reminiscent of the
expected convergence of the velocity field at large distances to any prescribed
constant vector field. This explicit parameterization of the weak solutions
allows us to prove a weak-strong uniqueness theorem for small data. The
question of the asymptotic behavior of the weak solutions remains however open,
when the uniqueness theorem doesn't apply.

What method was used to analyze data from the Phoenix lander to estimate dust devil occurrence rates?,e41bdb6a,"Title: A Framework for Relating the Structures and Recovery Statistics in Pressure Time-Series Surveys for Dust Devils

        Abstract:   Dust devils are likely the dominant source of dust for the martian
atmosphere, but the amount and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the
statistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure
perturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as
a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several
surveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil
structures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such
surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil
properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with
the widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be
distorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such
surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure
time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series
cannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical
and geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of
the duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a
distribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the
underlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a
scheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey
using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil
occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our
results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five
low-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.

more recurrent layers sandwiched between an embedding layer used for
representing input tokens and a softmax layer for generating output tokens. For
problems with a very large vocabulary size, the embedding and the softmax
matrices can account for more than half of the model size. For instance, the

can significantly outperform traditional compression methods such as low-rank
approximation and pruning. On the OBW dataset, our method achieved 6.6 times

In this work, we show that it is NP-hard to make this determination for any accuracy parameter, even when we restrict ourselves to instances which are either RIP or far from being RIP. This result implies that it is NP-hard to approximate the range of parameters for which a matrix possesses the Restricted Isometry Property with accuracy better than some constant. Ours is the first work to prove such a claim without any additional assumptions.

Significance: Proving the NP-hardness of determining the Restricted Isometry Property without additional assumptions demonstrates the difficulty of approximating this property in a wide range of parameters. This result has significant implications for the field of compressed sensing and provides a fundamental limit on the accuracy of algorithms used to determine whether a matrix is RIP.",0.9649015

What limitations does using the Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method pose for nanoparticle size measurements in biological samples?,1673853e,"Title: The effects of subdiffusion on the NTA size measurements of extracellular vesicles in biological samples

        Abstract:   The interest in the extracellular vesicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as they
became reliable biomarkers for many diseases. For this reason, fast and
accurate techniques of EVs size characterization are the matter of utmost
importance. One increasingly popular technique is the Nanoparticle Tracking
Analysis (NTA), in which the diameters of EVs are calculated from their
diffusion constants. The crucial assumption here is that the diffusion in NTA
follows the Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. that the Mean Square Displacement
(MSD) of a particle grows linearly in time (MSD $\propto t$). However, we show
that NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples,
i.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour
(MSD $\propto t^\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$). To support this observation we present
a range of experimental results for both polystyrene beads and EVs. This is
also related to another problem: for the same samples there exists a huge
discrepancy (by the factor of 2-4) between the sizes measured with NTA and with
the direct imaging methods, such as AFM. This can be remedied by e.g. the
Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is
limited in the biological and poly-disperse samples. On the other hand, the
models of sub-diffusion rarely provide the direct relation between the size of
a particle and the generalized diffusion constant. However, we solve this last
problem by introducing the logarithmic model of sub-diffusion, aimed at
retrieving the size data. In result, we propose a novel protocol of NTA data
analysis. The accuracy of our method is on par with FTLA for small
($\simeq$200nm) particles. We apply our method to study the EVs samples and
corroborate the results with AFM.
","The limitations of using the Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method for nanoparticle size measurements in biological samples are discussed in the paper titled ""The effects of subdiffusion on the NTA size measurements of extracellular vesicles in biological samples"".

The abstract states: ""However, we show that NTA violates this assumption in both artificial and biological samples, i.e. a large population of particles show a strongly sub-diffusive behaviour (MSD ∝ t^α, 0<α<1). This can be remedied by e.g. the Finite Track Length Adjustment (FTLA) method in NTA, but its applicability is limited in the biological and poly-disperse samples.""

How do starspots and faculae affect the observation of exoplanet spectra?,dbc9f6d4,"Title: Forecasting the Impact of Stellar Activity on Transiting Exoplanet Spectra

        Abstract:   Exoplanet host star activity, in the form of unocculted star spots or
faculae, alters the observed transmission and emission spectra of the
exoplanet. This effect can be exacerbated when combining data from different
epochs if the stellar photosphere varies between observations due to activity.
redHere we present a method to characterize and correct for relative changes
due to stellar activity by exploiting multi-epoch ($\ge$2 visits/transits)
observations to place them in a consistent reference frame. Using measurements
from portions of the planet's orbit where negligible planet transmission or
emission can be assumed, we determine changes to the stellar spectral
amplitude. With the analytical methods described here, we predict the impact of
stellar variability on transit observations. Supplementing these forecasts with
Kepler-measured stellar variabilities for F-, G-, K-, and M-dwarfs, and
predicted transit precisions by JWST's NIRISS, NIRCam, and MIRI, we conclude
that stellar activity does not impact infrared transiting exoplanet

What effect does the structure of social networks have on the spread of alternative choices?,ecf1c3c3,"Title: Hipsters on Networks: How a Small Group of Individuals Can Lead to an Anti-Establishment Majority

        Abstract:   The spread of opinions, memes, diseases, and ""alternative facts"" in a
population depends both on the details of the spreading process and on the
structure of the social and communication networks on which they spread. In
this paper, we explore how \textit{anti-establishment} nodes (e.g.,
\textit{hipsters}) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products.
We consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for
updating node states (which describe which product has been adopted) in which
an adjustable fraction $p_{\rm Hip}$ of the nodes in a network are hipsters,
who choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the
two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by
considering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate
our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters
have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product:
even when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the
simulations, a very small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the
other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this
behavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fraction
on $k$-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our
simulations demonstrate that a time delay $\tau$ in the knowledge of the
product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of
product adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final
distribution of product adoptions. Our simple model and analysis may help shed
light on the road to success for anti-establishment choices in elections, as
such success can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of
anti-establishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on
normal individuals.
","Based on the provided papers, I found that the structure of social networks can significantly impact the spread of alternative choices.

Abstract: This paper explores how anti-establishment nodes (e.g., hipsters) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products in a network.

What type of functions are used to define families of zeta$-kindred elements?,063757ba,"Title: Jacob's ladders, crossbreeding in the set of $ζ$-factorization formulas and selection of families of $ζ$-kindred real continuous functions

        Abstract:   In this paper we introduce the notion of $\zeta$-crossbreeding in a set of
$\zeta$-factorization formulas and also the notion of complete hybrid formula
as the final result of that crossbreeding. The last formula is used as a
criterion for selection of families of $\zeta$-kindred elements in class of
real continuous functions.
Dedicated to recalling of Gregory Mendel's pea-crossbreeding.

Title: Jacob's ladders, crossbreeding in the set of $ζ$-factorization formulas and selection of families of $ζ$-kindred real continuous functions

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of $\zeta$-crossbreeding in a set of $\zeta$-factorization formulas and also the notion of complete hybrid formula as the final result of that crossbreeding. The last formula is used as a criterion for selection of families of $\zeta$-kindred elements in the class of real continuous functions.

According to this paper, families of $\zeta$-kindred elements are defined using real continuous functions.",0.9591111
what is the first general purpose framework for marginal maximum a posteriori estimation of probabilistic program variables,f34c282a,"Title: Bayesian Optimization for Probabilistic Programs

        Abstract:   We present the first general purpose framework for marginal maximum a
posteriori estimation of probabilistic program variables. By using a series of
code transformations, the evidence of any probabilistic program, and therefore
of any graphical model, can be optimized with respect to an arbitrary subset of
its sampled variables. To carry out this optimization, we develop the first
Bayesian optimization package to directly exploit the source code of its
target, leading to innovations in problem-independent hyperpriors, unbounded
optimization, and implicit constraint satisfaction; delivering significant
performance improvements over prominent existing packages. We present
applications of our method to a number of tasks including engineering design
and parameter optimization.
