Simulation results using the second reformulation on a specific tensegrity spine robot show reasonable open-loop control results, whereas the previous formulation could not produce any solution.\"},\n",

The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons. Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding at the level of early unisensory cortices. Our proposed architecture provides possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology with behaviour.\\n\\nThe answer lies in the abstract, specifically: \"The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons.\" This suggests that the dorsal processing pathways play a key role in multisensory integration by providing a neural network architecture that enables the brain to process multiple sensory inputs in combination.'},\n",

This interloper exhibits a variable colour within a range that is broadly consistent with local small bodies such as the P/D type asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and dynamically excited Kuiper Belt Objects. 1I/'Oumuamua appears unusually elongated in shape, with an axial ratio exceeding 5:1. Rotation period estimates are inconsistent and varied, with reported values between 6.9 and 8.3 hours. Here we analyse all available optical photometry reported to date. No single rotation period can explain the exhibited brightness variations. Rather, 1I/'Oumuamua appears to be in an excited rotational state undergoing Non-Principal Axis (NPA) rotation, or tumbling. A satisfactory solution has apparent lightcurve frequencies of 0.135 and 0.126 hr-1 and implies a longest-to-shortest axis ratio of 5:1, though the available data are insufficient to uniquely constrain the true frequencies and shape.

From these observations, we derived a partial lightcurve with peak-to-trough amplitude of at least 1.2 mag. This lightcurve segment rules out rotation periods less than 3 hr and suggests that the period is at least 5 hr. On the assumption that the variability is due to a changing cross section, the axial ratio is at least 3:1. We saw no evidence for a coma or tail in either individual images or in a stacked image having an equivalent exposure time of 9000 s.\\n\\nThe estimated rotation period values for 'Oumuamua are between 6.9 and 8.3 hours, and at least 5 hours.\"},\n",

Emphasis is put on the effect of the spectral density on the exciton state populations as well as on the vibrational and vibronic non-equilibrium excitations. Models which use either a single or site-specific spectral densities are contrasted to a spectral density adapted from experiment. For the transfer efficiency, the total integrated Huang-Rhys factor is found to be more important than details of the spectral distributions. However, the latter are relevant for the obtained non-equilibrium vibrational and vibronic distributions and thus influence the actual pattern of population relaxation.\\n\\nAccording to the abstract, the total integrated Huang-Rhys factor is more important than the spectral distributions in determining the transfer efficiency within the FMO complex.'},\n",

By a combination of mean-field theory and computer simulation we calculate the flux of both species of rods and their density profiles as well as the composite phase diagrams of the system. If the bottleneck is sufficiently stringent some of the phases become practically unrealizable although not ruled out on the basis of any fundamental physical principle. Moreover the extent of suppression of flow of the downstream entrants by the flow of the upstream entrants can also be regulated by the strength of the bottleneck. We speculate on the possible implications of the results in the context of the biological phenomenon that motivated the formulation of the theoretical model.'},\n",

The\\nkey challenge is how to assign rating scores to the fake users such that the\\ntarget item is recommended to as many normal users as possible.

We evaluate our attacks and\\ncompare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm\\nand its parameters are known), gray-box (recommendation algorithm is known but\\nits parameters are unknown), and black-box (recommendation algorithm is\\nunknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our\\nattack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based\\nrecommender systems. For instance, when 1% fake users are injected, our attack\\ncan make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain\\nscenarios.\\n',\n",

Our approach exploits the diffraction properties of sound waves as they bend around a barrier or an obstacle in the scene. We combine a ray tracing based sound propagation algorithm with a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model, which simulate bending effects by placing a virtual sound source on a wedge in the environment. We precompute the wedges of a reconstructed mesh of an indoor scene and use them to generate diffraction acoustic rays to localize the 3D position of the source. Our method identifies the convergence region of those generated acoustic rays as the estimated source position based on a particle filter. We have evaluated our algorithm in multiple scenarios consisting of a static and dynamic NLOS sound source. In our tested cases, our approach can localize a source position with an average accuracy error, 0.7m, measured by the L2 distance between estimated and actual source locations in a 7m*7m*3m room. Furthermore, we observe 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over a state-of-the-art localization method that does not model diffraction effects, especially when a sound source is not visible to the robot.\\n\\nThe advantages of integrating a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model into a sound propagation algorithm are:\\n\\n* Improved accuracy in localizing sound sources, with an average accuracy error of 0.7m.\\n* Ability to localize sound sources even when they are not visible to the robot.\\n* 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art localization methods that do not model diffraction effects.'},\n",

Feature selection (FS) algorithms and hyper-parameter optimizations are simultaneously considered during model training. The five most commonly used FS methods including weight by Gini, weight by Chi-square, hierarchical variable clustering, weight by correlation, and weight by information are applied to alleviate the effect of redundant features. Two hyper-parameter optimization approaches, random search (RS) and Bayesian tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), are applied in XGBoost. The effect of different FS and hyper-parameter optimization methods on the model performance are investigated by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The performance of XGBoost is compared to the traditionally utilized logistic regression (LR) model in terms of classification accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), recall, and F1 score obtained from the 10-fold cross validation. Results show that hierarchical clustering is the optimal FS method for LR while weight by Chi-square achieves the best performance in XG-Boost. Both TPE and RS optimization in XGBoost outperform LR significantly. TPE optimization shows a superiority over RS since it results in a significantly higher accuracy and a marginally higher AUC, recall and F1 score. Furthermore, XGBoost with TPE tuning shows a lower variability than the RS method. Finally, the ranking of feature importance based on XGBoost enhances the model interpretation. Therefore, XGBoost with Bayesian TPE hyper-parameter optimization serves as an operative while powerful approach for business risk modeling.'},\n",

To finally predict the outflow hydrograph for real case applications, an alternative residual model was formulated that assumes perfect data and a perfect model. The fully probabilistic fashion of hydrograph prediction has the potential to improve the adequate risk management of downstream flooding.\\n\\nThe main source of uncertainty identified in the posterior distribution of the dam breach model is a correlated subset of parameters, consisting of the residual error term and the epistemic term quantifying the breach erosion rate.'},\n",

The implanted samples were annealed at 950 C for 30 minutes in Ar ambience. Topographical studies of implanted as well as annealed samples were captured by the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Two dimension (2D) multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) based on the partition function approach has been used to study the surfaces of ion implanted and annealed samples. The partition function is used to calculate generalized Hurst exponent with the segment size. Moreover, it is seen that the generalized Hurst exponents vary nonlinearly with the moment, thereby exhibiting the multifractal nature. The multifractality of surface is pronounced after annealing for the surface implanted with fluence 7.5X1016 ions/cm^2.\\n\\nThe relationship between the generalized Hurst exponent and the segment size in multifractal analysis is that the generalized Hurst exponents vary nonlinearly with the moment, which is calculated using the partition function approach with the segment size.'},\n",

In the absence of hawks, doves share the resource equally and avoid conflict, but having hawks around lead to doves escaping without fighting. Conversely, hawks fight for the resource at the cost of getting injured. Nevertheless, if doves are present in sufficient number to expel the hawks, they can aggregate to protect the resource, and thus avoid being plundered by hawks. We derive and numerically solve an exact equation for the evolution of the system in both finite and infinite well-mixed populations, finding the conditions for stable coexistence between both species. Furthermore, by varying the different parameters, we found a scenario of bifurcations that leads the system from dominating hawks and coexistence to bi-stability, multiple interior equilibria and dominating doves.\\n\\nIn this scenario, doves become dominant over hawks when they are present in sufficient numbers to expel the hawks and aggregate to protect the resource, thereby avoiding being plundered by hawks.'},\n",

In order to extend\\nour simulation capability at the mesoscale to include weak shock conditions (<\\n6 GPa), atomistic simulations of pore collapse are used to define a strain rate\\ndependent strength model. Comparing these simulation methods allows us to\\nimpose physically-reasonable constraints on the mesoscale model parameters. In\\ndoing so, we have been able to study shock waves interacting with pores as a\\nfunction of this viscoplastic material response.

Such streams can be used as leaning tower gravitational experiments on galactic scales. The most well motivated modification of gravity proposed as an alternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND), and we present here the first ever N-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a realistic baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we attempt to reproduce the present-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf and its immense tidal stream that wraps around the Milky Way. With very little freedom on the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total luminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size relation for isolated dwarf galaxies, we find reasonable agreement between our simulations and observations of this system. The observed stellar velocities in the leading arm can be reproduced if we include a massive hot gas corona around the Milky Way that is flattened in the direction of the principal plane of its satellites. This is the first time that tidal dissolution in MOND has been tested rigorously at these mass and acceleration scales.'},\n",

They serve as base models for composition, can simulate human prediction and provide a multidisciplinary application domain for learning algorithms. A particularly well established and constantly advanced subtask is the prediction of monophonic melodies. As melodies typically involve non-Markovian dependencies their prediction requires a capable learning algorithm. In this thesis, I apply the recent feature discovery and learning method PULSE to the realm of symbolic music modeling. PULSE is comprised of a feature generating operation and L1-regularized optimization. These are used to iteratively expand and cull the feature set, effectively exploring feature spaces that are too large for common feature selection approaches. I design a general Python framework for PULSE, propose task-optimized feature generating operations and various music-theoretically motivated features that are evaluated on a standard corpus of monophonic folk and chorale melodies. The proposed method significantly outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models. I further discuss the free parameters of the learning algorithm and analyze the feature composition of the learned models. The models learned by PULSE afford an easy inspection and are musicologically interpreted for the first time.'},\n",

       "  'llm_ans': 'Title: Growing length scale accompanying the vitrification: A perspective based on non-singular density fluctuations\\n\\nAbstract: In glass forming liquids close to the glass transition point, even a very slight increase in the macroscopic density results in a dramatic slowing down of the macroscopic relaxation. Concomitantly, the local density itself fluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local density variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective, a model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is introduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a certain threshold value, $\\\\rho_{\\\\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle rearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period ($\\\\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy cluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict that with compression (increasing average density $\\\\rho$) at a fixed temperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the clusters, $\\\\xi$, diverges as $\\\\xi\\\\sim(\\\\rho_{\\\\rm c}-\\\\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimensionality.

Gain bounds often imply exponential stability, but it can be challenging to compute useful numerical bounds on the exponential decay rate. This work presents a generalization of the classical IQC results of Megretski and Rantzer that leads to a tractable computational procedure for finding exponential rate certificates that are far less conservative than ones computed from $L_2$ gain bounds alone.

However, it is important, for both theoreticians and practitioners, to gain a deeper understanding of the difficulties and limitations associated with common approaches and algorithms. We describe four types of simple problems, for which the gradient-based algorithms commonly used in deep learning either fail or suffer from significant difficulties.

We present several new results and collect in a unified view a variety of results scattered in the literature, often providing simplified proofs. Novel contributions include the analysis of infinite dimensional convex minimization problems, allowing the case where minimizers might not exist. Further, we analyze the relation between different geometric conditions, and discuss novel connections with a priori conditions in linear inverse problems, including source conditions, restricted isometry properties and partial smoothness.\\n\\nNo specific problem type is mentioned for demonstrating the performance of this algorithm.\\n\\nTitle: Automatic Analysis, Decomposition and Parallel Optimization of Large Homogeneous Networks\\n\\nAbstract: The life of the modern world essentially depends on the work of the large artificial homogeneous networks, such as wired and wireless communication systems, networks of roads and pipelines. The support of their effective continuous functioning requires automatic screening and permanent optimization with processing of the huge amount of data by high-performance distributed systems. We propose new meta-algorithm of large homogeneous network analysis, its decomposition into alternative sets of loosely connected subnets, and parallel optimization of the most independent elements. This algorithm is based on a network-specific correlation function, Simulated Annealing technique, and is adapted to work in the computer cluster. On the example of large wireless network, we show that proposed algorithm essentially increases speed of parallel optimization. The elaborated general approach can be used for analysis and optimization of the wide range of networks, including such specific types as artificial neural networks or organized in networks physiological systems of living organisms.\\n\\nThe type of problem used to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm is a large wireless network.\\n\\nTitle: Asynchronous Byzantine Machine Learning (the case of SGD)\\n\\nAbstract: Asynchronous distributed machine learning solutions have proven very effective so far, but always assuming perfectly functioning workers. In practice, some of the workers can however exhibit Byzantine behavior, caused by hardware failures, software bugs, corrupt data, or even malicious attacks. We introduce \\\\emph{Kardam}, the first distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that copes with Byzantine workers. Kardam consists of two complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first is scalar-based and ensures resilience against $\\\\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers. Essentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts as a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt the progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by adjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme. We prove that Kardam guarantees almost sure convergence in the presence of asynchrony and Byzantine behavior, and we derive its convergence rate. We evaluate Kardam on the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets and measure its overhead with respect to non Byzantine-resilient solutions. We empirically show that Kardam does not introduce additional noise to the learning procedure but does induce a slowdown (the cost of Byzantine resilience) that we both theoretically and empirically show to be less than $f/n$, where $f$ is the number of Byzantine failures tolerated and $n$ the total number of workers.\\n\\nThe types of problems used to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm are the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets.'},\n",

DeepFense formalizes the goal of thwarting adversarial attacks as an optimization problem that minimizes the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network. To solve the aforementioned minimization problem, a set of complementary but disjoint modular redundancies are trained to validate the legitimacy of the input samples in parallel with the victim DL model. DeepFense leverages hardware/software/algorithm co-design and customized acceleration to achieve just-in-time performance in resource-constrained settings. The proposed countermeasure is unsupervised, meaning that no adversarial sample is leveraged to train modular redundancies. We further provide an accompanying API to reduce the non-recurring engineering cost and ensure automated adaptation to various platforms. Extensive evaluations on FPGAs and GPUs demonstrate up to two orders of magnitude performance improvement while enabling online adversarial sample detection.\\n\\nDeepFense addresses the challenge of adversarial attacks on Deep Learning models by formalizing the goal of thwarting adversarial attacks as an optimization problem that minimizes the rarely observed regions in the latent feature space spanned by a DL network.

This hands-free neurofeedback interaction not only can be used for mind control of a social robot's movements, but also sets the stage for application to enhancing and recovering mental abilities such as attention via training in humans by providing real-time neurofeedback from a social robot.\"},\n",

This weakly supervised object localisation problem has been tackled in the past using discriminative models where each object class is localised independently from other classes.

Attention-based Natural Language Person Retrieval**\\n\\nAbstract: Following the recent progress in image classification and captioning using deep learning, we develop a novel natural language person retrieval system based on an attention mechanism. More specifically, given the description of a person, the goal is to localize the person in an image. To this end, we first construct a benchmark dataset for natural language person retrieval. To do so, we generate bounding boxes for persons in a public image dataset from the segmentation masks, which are then annotated with descriptions and attributes using the Amazon Mechanical Turk. We then adopt a region proposal network in Faster R-CNN as a candidate region generator. The cropped images based on the region proposals as well as the whole images with attention weights are fed into Convolutional Neural Networks for visual feature extraction, while the natural language expression and attributes are input to Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) models for text feature extraction. The visual and text features are integrated to score region proposals, and the one with the highest score is retrieved as the output of our system. The experimental results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method for generic object retrieval and this line of research promises to benefit search in surveillance video footage.'},\n",

These quasi-metametrics, as their names suggest, dispense with one or two standard axioms of metric spaces, specifically distinguishability and symmetry, so that similarity between data points of arbitrary type and form could be measured broadly and effectively. The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features. By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and text extracted via deep learning approaches. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for structured data including categorical and continuous data, the near-metrics corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and images including those extracted from deep learning, the near-metrics derived from normalized and reverse k-step graph diffusion (k very small) exhibit outstanding ability to distinguish data points from different classes.\\n\\n**Method 3:** Distance-based Discriminative Framework\\n\\nTitle: Distance Measure Machines\\n\\nAbstract: This paper presents a distance-based discriminative framework for learning with probability distributions. Instead of using kernel mean embeddings or generalized radial basis kernels, we introduce embeddings based on dissimilarity of distributions to some reference distributions denoted as templates. Our framework extends the theory of similarity of Balcan et al. (2008) to the population distribution case and we show that, for some learning problems, some dissimilarity on distribution achieves low-error linear decision functions with high probability. Our key result is to prove that the theory also holds for empirical distributions. Algorithmically, the proposed approach consists in computing a mapping based on pairwise dissimilarity where learning a linear decision function is amenable. Our experimental results show that the Wasserstein distance embedding performs better than kernel mean embeddings and computing Wasserstein distance is far more tractable than estimating pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence of empirical distributions.\\n\\nI hope these papers are relevant to your research!'},\n",

Furthermore, it must also have a mechanism through which it can keep sensory inputs calibrated to maintain the accuracy of its internal representations. We have developed a neural network architecture capable of i) approximating optimal multisensory spatial integration, based on Bayesian causal inference, and ii) recalibrating the spatial encoding of sensory systems. The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons. Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding at the level of early unisensory cortices. Our proposed architecture provides possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology with behaviour.\\n\\nThis abstract mentions \"top-down feedback connections\" which could be related to the aspect of the neural architecture that allows for top-down information transfer.

This study aims to explore how companies that adopt ASD implement KM strategies utilizing practices that promote the KPs in the different organizational layers. Through a systematic literature review, we analyzed 32 primary studies, selected by automated search and snowballing in the extant literature. To analyze the data, we applied narrative synthesis. Most of the identified KM practices implement personalization strategies (81 %), supported by codification (19 %). Our review shows that the primary studies do not report KM practices in the strategic layer and two of them in the product portfolio layer; on the other hand, in the project layer, the studies report 33 practices that implement personalization strategy, and seven practices that implement codification. KM strategies in ASD promote mainly the knowledge transfer process with practices that stimulate social interaction to share tacit knowledge in the project layer.

In the absence of hand-crafted reward functions, prior work on the topic has proposed several methods for reward estimation by using expert state trajectories and action pairs. However, there are cases where complete or good action information cannot be obtained from expert demonstrations. We propose a novel reinforcement learning method in which the agent learns an internal model of observation on the basis of expert-demonstrated state trajectories to estimate rewards without completely learning the dynamics of the external environment from state-action pairs. The internal model is obtained in the form of a predictive model for the given expert state distribution. During reinforcement learning, the agent predicts the reward as a function of the difference between the actual state and the state predicted by the internal model. We conducted multiple experiments in environments of varying complexity, including the Super Mario Bros and Flappy Bird games. We show our method successfully trains good policies directly from expert game-play videos.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a method for learning an internal model from observations, which can be used to predict future states and plan accordingly.

[Quantum. Inf. Process. 11, 853 (2012)] have defined a measure of non-Gaussian character of quantum optical states in terms of Wehrl entropy. Here, we adopt this concept in the context of single mode NC. In this paper, we propose a new quantification of NC for the single mode quantum states of light as the difference between the total Wehrl entropy of the state and the maximum Wehrl entropy arising due to its classical characteristics. This we achieve by subtracting from its Wehrl entropy, the maximum Wehrl entropy attainable by any classical state that has same randomness as measured in terms of von-Neumann entropy. We obtain analytic expressions of NC for most of the states, in particular, all pure states and Gaussian mixed states. However, the evaluation of NC for the non-Gaussian mixed states is subject to extensive numerical computation that lies beyond the scope of the current work. We show that, along with the states generated under single NC-inducing operations, also for the broader class of states that are generated under multiple NC-inducing operations, our quantification enumerates the NC consistently.\\n\\nPotential challenge: The challenge in calculating the nonclassicality for non-Gaussian mixed states is the need for extensive numerical computation.'},\n",

That is unacceptable. Second, those same systems are also extremely susceptible to strategic insincere voting. Third, in simulation studies using spatial models with two candidates, the best known alternative to MR picks the best or most centrist candidate significantly less often than MR does.'},\n",

To avoid these problems, we first propose to use a discriminative component with stochastic inputs for increased noise flexibility. We show how an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure can marginalize the stochastic inputs when inferring missing labels in this model. Following this, we extend the discriminative component to be fully Bayesian and produce estimates of uncertainty in its parameter values.

This is based on the fact that a fully connected feedforward network with one hidden layer, a certain weight distribution, an activation function, and an infinite number of neurons can be viewed as a mapping into a Hilbert space. We derive the equivalent kernels of MLPs with ReLU or Leaky ReLU activations for all rotationally-invariant weight distributions, generalizing a previous result that required Gaussian weight distributions. Additionally, the Central Limit Theorem is used to show that for certain activation functions, kernels corresponding to layers with weight distributions having $0$ mean and finite absolute third moment are asymptotically universal, and are well approximated by the kernel corresponding to layers with spherical Gaussian weights. In deep networks, as depth increases the equivalent kernel approaches a pathological fixed point, which can be used to argue why training randomly initialized networks can be difficult.

For the (zero-dimensional) special case of the X-ray-edge singularity, we show that the leading log formula can be analytically reproduced in a consistent way from a truncated, one-loop fRG flow.

The shared bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal channels. In the beginning of each time slot, each user selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain transmission probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is a multi-user strategy for accessing the spectrum that maximizes a certain network utility in a distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used to maximize the objective function. Game theoretic analysis of the system dynamics is developed for establishing design principles for the implementation of the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of the algorithm.\\n\\nAdditionally, I also found another relevant paper:\\n\\nTitle: Multi-User Multi-Armed Bandits for Uncoordinated Spectrum Access\\n\\nAbstract: A multi-user multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is used to develop algorithms for uncoordinated spectrum access.

We improve over a recent state-of-the-art camera calibration method for traffic surveillance based on two detected vanishing points. More importantly, we propose a novel automatic scene scale inference method. The method is based on matching bounding boxes of rendered 3D models of vehicles with detected bounding boxes in the image. The proposed method can be used from arbitrary viewpoints, since it has no constraints on camera placement. We evaluate our method on the recent comprehensive dataset for speed measurement BrnoCompSpeed. Experiments show that our automatic camera calibration method by detection of two vanishing points reduces error by 50% (mean distance ratio error reduced from 0.18 to 0.09) compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. We also show that our scene scale inference method is more precise, outperforming both state-of-the-art automatic calibration method for speed measurement (error reduction by 86% -- 7.98km/h to 1.10km/h) and manual calibration (error reduction by 19% -- 1.35km/h to 1.10km/h).

Partially due to the NP-hardness, the existing techniques for computing GED are only able to process very small graphs with less than 30 vertices. Motivated by this, in this paper we systematically study the problems of both GED computation, and GED verification (i.e., verify whether the GED between two graphs is no larger than a user-given threshold). Firstly, we develop a unified framework that can be instantiated into either a best-first search approach AStar+ or a depth-first search approach DFS+. Secondly, we design anchor-aware lower bound estimation techniques to compute tighter lower bounds for intermediate search states, which significantly reduce the search spaces of both AStar+ and DFS+. We also propose efficient techniques to compute the lower bounds. Thirdly, based on our unified framework, we contrast AStar+ with DFS+ regarding their time and space complexities, and recommend that AStar+ is better than DFS+ by having a much smaller search space.

Although, the problem has largely been overcome via carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization, architectures incorporating skip-connections such as highway and resnets perform much better than standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen initialization and batch normalization. In this paper, we identify the shattered gradients problem. Specifically, we show that the correlation between gradients in standard feedforward networks decays exponentially with depth resulting in gradients that resemble white noise whereas, in contrast, the gradients in architectures with skip-connections are far more resistant to shattering, decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets. Finally, we present a new \"looks linear\" (LL) initialization that prevents shattering, with preliminary experiments showing the new initialization allows to train very deep networks without the addition of skip-connections.'},\n",

Numerical evidence shows that our procedure works very well in finite samples, with a very small probability of false detections and tight detection times in presence of a genuine change-point.'},\n",

These quasi-metametrics, as their names suggest, dispense with one or two standard axioms of metric spaces, specifically distinguishability and symmetry, so that similarity between data points of arbitrary type and form could be measured broadly and effectively. The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features. By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and text extracted via deep learning approaches. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for structured data including categorical and continuous data, the near-metrics corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and images including those extracted from deep learning, the near-metrics derived from normalized and reverse k-step graph diffusion (k very small) exhibit outstanding ability to distinguish data points from different classes.\\n\\nThis paper discusses a new family of near-metrics, which can be seen as a relaxation of classical metrics. While classical metrics follow certain axioms (distinguishability and symmetry), these near-metrics dispense with one or two of these axioms to capture similarity between data points in a more flexible way.'},\n",

This motivates the need for a real-time, probabilistic forecasting algorithm for pedestrians, cyclists, and other agents since these predictions will form a necessary step in assessing the risk of any action. This paper presents a novel approach to probabilistic forecasting for pedestrians based on weighted sums of ordinary differential equations that are learned from historical trajectory information within a fixed scene. The resulting algorithm is embarrassingly parallel and is able to work at real-time speeds using a naive Python implementation.

Using a novel core-periphery detection method on the eMID interbank market, we enrich this picture by showing that the network is actually characterised by multiple core-periphery pairs. Moreover, a transition from core-periphery to bipartite structures occurs by shortening the temporal scale of data aggregation. We further show how the global financial crisis transformed the market, in terms of composition, multiplicity and internal organisation of core-periphery pairs. By unveiling such a fine-grained organisation and transformation of the interbank market, our method can find important applications in the understanding of how distress can propagate over financial networks.'},\n",

The overall intensity change of the background corrected data from the inner to the outer boundary of the heliosheath is a maximum of a factor ~100 at 15 MeV. At lower energies this fractional change becomes less and the corrected electron spectra in the heliosheath becomes progressively steeper, reaching values ~ -2.5 for the spectral index just outside of the termination shock. At higher energies the spectra of electrons has an exponent changing from the negative LIS spectral index of -1.3 to values approaching zero in the heliosheath as a result of the solar modulation of the galactic electron component. The large modulation effects observed below ~100 MV are possible evidence for enhanced diffusion as part of the modulation process for electrons in the heliosheath.\\n\\nThis research paper suggests that Voyager 1 provides evidence for enhanced diffusion in the heliosheath.'},\n",

       "  'llm_ans': 'Title: From bare interactions, low--energy constants and unitary gas to nuclear density functionals without free parameters: application to neutron matter\\n\\nAbstract:   We further progress along the line of Ref. [Phys. Rev. {\\\\bf A 94}, 043614\\n(2016)] where a functional for Fermi systems with anomalously large $s$-wave\\nscattering length $a_s$ was proposed that has no free parameters. The\\nfunctional is designed to correctly reproduce the unitary limit in Fermi gases\\ntogether with the leading-order contributions in the s- and p-wave channels at\\nlow density. The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities\\n$\\\\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang\\nfunctional, valid for $\\\\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional\\nretained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional\\ncorresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all\\norders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One\\nconclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density\\nregime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with\\nrespect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce\\ndensity--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare\\ninteraction are strongly renormalized by medium effects.

The evidence of star formation proceeding over several million years within individual spurs implies that the mechanism that leads to star formation acts or is sustained over a longer time-scale.\\n\\nThe factors that contribute to the development of star formation in spiral arm spurs within galaxies like M51, according to this study, include:\\n\\n* Localized mechanisms that delay star formation, allowing it to occur in spurs\\n* Strong star formation feedback in gas spurs\\n* Tentative evidence for star formation triggered by stellar feedback\\n* The presence of gas spurs and extinction feathers arising from the same structure\\n* Close spatial relation between gas spurs and ongoing/recent star formation despite higher gas surface densities in the spiral arm\\n\\nPlease let me know if you would like me to search for more information or clarify any of these points.'},\n",

A convolutional neural network is trained on a collection of discrete, parameterizable fluid simulation velocity fields. Due to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate the training data set, while providing plausible interpolated in-betweens. The proposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that guarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and compression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are generated up to 700x faster than traditional CPU solvers, while achieving compression rates of over 1300x.\\n\\nIn this paper, the authors demonstrate that a neural network trained on a generative model can be used for tasks such as:\\n\\n* Fast construction of simulations\\n* Interpolation of fluids with different parameters\\n* Time re-sampling\\n* Latent space simulations\\n* Compression of fluid simulation data\\n\\nThese tasks go beyond inference and showcase the capabilities of generative models in various applications.'},\n",

Moreover, the overall PID performance can be affected by high detector occupancy as the pattern recognition becomes more difficult with high particle multiplicities. This paper shows a way to improve performance by systematically addressing each of the previously mentioned limitations. These ideas are applied in the present and future upgrade phases of the LHCb experiment.

It is concluded that\\nissues previously considered obstacles for TI are no longer legitimately viewed\\nas such, and that reconsideration of the transactional picture is warranted in\\nconnection with solving the measurement problem.\\n\\nThis paper addresses the impact of relativistic field theories, including the asymmetry between field sources and bosonic fields, on the contingent absorber challenge, and concludes that these features prevent the challenge scenario from existing.\"},\n",

       "  'llm_ans': 'Title: Is It Safe to Uplift This Patch? An Empirical Study on Mozilla Firefox\\n\\nAbstract:   In rapid release development processes, patches that fix critical issues, or\\nimplement high-value features are often promoted directly from the development\\nchannel to a stabilization channel, potentially skipping one or more\\nstabilization channels. This practice is called patch uplift. Patch uplift is\\nrisky, because patches that are rushed through the stabilization phase can end\\nup introducing regressions in the code. This paper examines patch uplift\\noperations at Mozilla, with the aim to identify the characteristics of uplifted\\npatches that introduce regressions. Through statistical and manual analyses, we\\nquantitatively and qualitatively investigate the reasons behind patch uplift\\ndecisions and the characteristics of uplifted patches that introduced\\nregressions. Additionally, we interviewed three Mozilla release managers to\\nunderstand organizational factors that affect patch uplift decisions and\\noutcomes. Results show that most patches are uplifted because of a wrong\\nfunctionality or a crash. Uplifted patches that lead to faults tend to have\\nlarger patch size, and most of the faults are due to semantic or memory errors\\nin the patches. Also, release managers are more inclined to accept patch uplift\\nrequests that concern certain specific components, and-or that are submitted by\\ncertain specific developers.'},\n",

Outside of reinforcement learning, sparse coding representations have been widely used, with non-convex objectives that result in discriminative representations. In this work, we develop a supervised sparse coding objective for policy evaluation. Despite the non-convexity of this objective, we prove that all local minima are global minima, making the approach amenable to simple optimization strategies. We empirically show that it is key to use a supervised objective, rather than the more straightforward unsupervised sparse coding approach. We compare the learned representations to a canonical fixed sparse representation, called tile-coding, demonstrating that the sparse coding representation outperforms a wide variety of tilecoding representations.\\n\\nThe paper states that \"Despite the non-convexity of this objective, we prove that all local minima are global minima, making the approach amenable to simple optimization strategies.\" This means that the sparse coding objective is suitable for optimization despite its non-convexity because all local minima are global minima, making it possible to find the optimal solution using simple optimization methods.'},\n",
