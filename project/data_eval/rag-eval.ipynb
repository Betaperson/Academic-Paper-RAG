Scaling arguments based on the processes observed as the ball interacts with the fluid surface were applied to the `pinch-off time', when the ball breaks its connection with the fluid from which it has been withdrawn, measured experimentally. At the lowest Reynolds numbers tested, pinch-off occurs in a `surface seal' close to the reservoir surface, where at larger Reynolds numbers pinch-off occurs in an `ejecta seal' close to the ball. Our scaling analysis shows that the connection between ball and fluid is controlled by the fluid film draining from the ball as it continues to be winched away from the fluid reservoir. The draining flow itself depends on the amount of fluid coating the ball on exit from the reservoir. We consider the possibilities that this coating was created through: a surface tension driven Landau Levitch Derjaguin wetting of the surface; a visco-inertial quick coating; or alternatively through the inertia of the fluid moving with the ball through the reservoir. We show that although the pinch-off mechanism is controlled by viscosity, the coating mechanism is governed by a different length and timescale, dictated by the inertial added mass of the ball when submersed.\\n\\nThe physical factor besides viscosity that influences the process of a ball becoming coated with fluid upon exiting a fluid reservoir is the inertial added mass of the ball when submerged.\"},\n",

Our proposed architecture provides possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology with behaviour.\\n\\nThe answer lies in the abstract, specifically: \"The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons.\" This suggests that the dorsal processing pathways play a key role in multisensory integration by providing a neural network architecture that enables the brain to process multiple sensory inputs in combination.'},\n",

This interloper exhibits a variable colour within a range that is broadly consistent with local small bodies such as the P/D type asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and dynamically excited Kuiper Belt Objects. 1I/'Oumuamua appears unusually elongated in shape, with an axial ratio exceeding 5:1. Rotation period estimates are inconsistent and varied, with reported values between 6.9 and 8.3 hours. Here we analyse all available optical photometry reported to date. No single rotation period can explain the exhibited brightness variations. Rather, 1I/'Oumuamua appears to be in an excited rotational state undergoing Non-Principal Axis (NPA) rotation, or tumbling. A satisfactory solution has apparent lightcurve frequencies of 0.135 and 0.126 hr-1 and implies a longest-to-shortest axis ratio of 5:1, though the available data are insufficient to uniquely constrain the true frequencies and shape. Assuming a body that responds to NPA rotation in a similar manner to Solar System asteroids and comets, the timescale to damp 1I/'Oumuamua's tumbling is at least a billion years. 1I/'Oumuamua was likely set tumbling within its parent planetary system, and will remain tumbling well after it has left ours.\\n\\nTitle: On the rotation period and shape of the hyperbolic asteroid 1I/`Oumuamua (2017) U1 from its lightcurve\\n\\nAbstract: We observed the newly discovered hyperbolic minor planet 1I/`Oumuamua (2017 U1) on 2017 October 30 with Lowell Observatory's 4.3-m Discovery Channel Telescope. From these observations, we derived a partial lightcurve with peak-to-trough amplitude of at least 1.2 mag. This lightcurve segment rules out rotation periods less than 3 hr and suggests that the period is at least 5 hr. On the assumption that the variability is due to a changing cross section, the axial ratio is at least 3:1. We saw no evidence for a coma or tail in either individual images or in a stacked image having an equivalent exposure time of 9000 s.\\n\\nThe estimated rotation period values for 'Oumuamua are between 6.9 and 8.3 hours, and at least 5 hours.\"},\n",

Mis-identification of central galaxies causes systematics in various studies such as cluster lensing, satellite kinematics, and galaxy clustering. The red-sequence Matched-filter Probabilistic Percolation (redMaPPer) estimates the probability that each member galaxy is central from photometric information rather than specifying one central galaxy. The redMaPPer estimates can be used for calibrating the off-centring effect, however, the centring algorithm has not previously been well-tested. We test the centring probabilities of redMaPPer cluster catalog using the projected cross correlation between redMaPPer clusters with photometric red galaxies and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We focus on the subsample of redMaPPer clusters in which the redMaPPer central galaxies (RMCGs) are not the brightest member galaxies (BMEM) and both of them have spectroscopic redshift. This subsample represents nearly 10% of the whole cluster sample. We find a clear difference in the cross-correlation measurements between RMCGs and BMEMs, and the estimated centring probability is 74$\\\\pm$10% for RMCGs and 13$\\\\pm$4% for BMEMs in the Gaussian offset model and 78$\\\\pm$9% for RMCGs and 5$\\\\pm$5% for BMEMs in the NFW offset model.

We compute corrections to the estimate of the luminosity distance due to velocity, volume, lensing and gravitational potential effects. Our results show that the amplitude of the corrections will be negligible for current instruments, mildly important for experiments like the planned DECIGO, and very important for future ones such as the Big Bang Observer.'},\n",

Experimental analysis with data for the Ijsselmeer lead to integral optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation of the IP model.

To address the\\nchallenge, we formulate the poisoning attacks as an optimization problem,\\nsolving which determines the rating scores for the fake users. We also propose\\ntechniques to solve the optimization problem. We evaluate our attacks and\\ncompare them with existing attacks under white-box (recommendation algorithm\\nand its parameters are known), gray-box (recommendation algorithm is known but\\nits parameters are unknown), and black-box (recommendation algorithm is\\nunknown) settings using two real-world datasets. Our results show that our\\nattack is effective and outperforms existing attacks for graph-based\\nrecommender systems. For instance, when 1% fake users are injected, our attack\\ncan make a target item recommended to 580 times more normal users in certain\\nscenarios.\\n',\n",

Several studies showed that recommender systems are vulnerable to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker injects fake data to a given system such that the system makes recommendations as the attacker desires. However, these poisoning attacks are either agnostic to recommendation algorithms or optimized to recommender systems that are not graph-based. Like association-rule-based and matrix-factorization-based recommender systems, graph-based recommender system is also deployed in practice, e.g., eBay, Huawei App Store. However, how to design optimized poisoning attacks for graph-based recommender systems is still an open problem.\\n\\nAccording to this abstract, the types of recommender systems that are susceptible to poisoning attacks are:\\n\\n1. Association-rule-based recommender systems\\n2. Matrix-factorization-based recommender systems\\n3. Graph-based recommender systems'},\n",

We have evaluated our algorithm in multiple scenarios consisting of a static and dynamic NLOS sound source. In our tested cases, our approach can localize a source position with an average accuracy error, 0.7m, measured by the L2 distance between estimated and actual source locations in a 7m*7m*3m room. Furthermore, we observe 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over a state-of-the-art localization method that does not model diffraction effects, especially when a sound source is not visible to the robot.\\n\\nThe advantages of integrating a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model into a sound propagation algorithm are:\\n\\n* Improved accuracy in localizing sound sources, with an average accuracy error of 0.7m.\\n* Ability to localize sound sources even when they are not visible to the robot.\\n* 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art localization methods that do not model diffraction effects.'},\n",

Feature selection (FS) algorithms and hyper-parameter optimizations are simultaneously considered during model training. The five most commonly used FS methods including weight by Gini, weight by Chi-square, hierarchical variable clustering, weight by correlation, and weight by information are applied to alleviate the effect of redundant features. Two hyper-parameter optimization approaches, random search (RS) and Bayesian tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), are applied in XGBoost. The effect of different FS and hyper-parameter optimization methods on the model performance are investigated by the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The performance of XGBoost is compared to the traditionally utilized logistic regression (LR) model in terms of classification accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), recall, and F1 score obtained from the 10-fold cross validation. Results show that hierarchical clustering is the optimal FS method for LR while weight by Chi-square achieves the best performance in XG-Boost. Both TPE and RS optimization in XGBoost outperform LR significantly. TPE optimization shows a superiority over RS since it results in a significantly higher accuracy and a marginally higher AUC, recall and F1 score. Furthermore, XGBoost with TPE tuning shows a lower variability than the RS method. Finally, the ranking of feature importance based on XGBoost enhances the model interpretation. Therefore, XGBoost with Bayesian TPE hyper-parameter optimization serves as an operative while powerful approach for business risk modeling.'},\n",

The implanted samples were annealed at 950 C for 30 minutes in Ar ambience. Topographical studies of implanted as well as annealed samples were captured by the atomic force microscopy (AFM). Two dimension (2D) multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) based on the partition function approach has been used to study the surfaces of ion implanted and annealed samples. The partition function is used to calculate generalized Hurst exponent with the segment size. Moreover, it is seen that the generalized Hurst exponents vary nonlinearly with the moment, thereby exhibiting the multifractal nature. The multifractality of surface is pronounced after annealing for the surface implanted with fluence 7.5X1016 ions/cm^2.\\n\\nThe relationship between the generalized Hurst exponent and the segment size in multifractal analysis is that the generalized Hurst exponents vary nonlinearly with the moment, which is calculated using the partition function approach with the segment size.'},\n",

We derive and numerically solve an exact equation for the evolution of the system in both finite and infinite well-mixed populations, finding the conditions for stable coexistence between both species. Furthermore, by varying the different parameters, we found a scenario of bifurcations that leads the system from dominating hawks and coexistence to bi-stability, multiple interior equilibria and dominating doves.\\n\\nIn this scenario, doves become dominant over hawks when they are present in sufficient numbers to expel the hawks and aggregate to protect the resource, thereby avoiding being plundered by hawks.'},\n",

Such streams can be used as leaning tower gravitational experiments on galactic scales. The most well motivated modification of gravity proposed as an alternative to dark matter on galactic scales is Milgromian dynamics (MOND), and we present here the first ever N-body simulations of the dynamical evolution of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in this framework. Using a realistic baryonic mass model for the Milky Way, we attempt to reproduce the present-day spatial and kinematic structure of the Sagittarius dwarf and its immense tidal stream that wraps around the Milky Way. With very little freedom on the original structure of the progenitor, constrained by the total luminosity of the Sagittarius structure and by the observed stellar mass-size relation for isolated dwarf galaxies, we find reasonable agreement between our simulations and observations of this system. The observed stellar velocities in the leading arm can be reproduced if we include a massive hot gas corona around the Milky Way that is flattened in the direction of the principal plane of its satellites. This is the first time that tidal dissolution in MOND has been tested rigorously at these mass and acceleration scales.'},\n",

They serve as base models for composition, can simulate human prediction and provide a multidisciplinary application domain for learning algorithms. A particularly well established and constantly advanced subtask is the prediction of monophonic melodies. As melodies typically involve non-Markovian dependencies their prediction requires a capable learning algorithm. In this thesis, I apply the recent feature discovery and learning method PULSE to the realm of symbolic music modeling. PULSE is comprised of a feature generating operation and L1-regularized optimization. These are used to iteratively expand and cull the feature set, effectively exploring feature spaces that are too large for common feature selection approaches. I design a general Python framework for PULSE, propose task-optimized feature generating operations and various music-theoretically motivated features that are evaluated on a standard corpus of monophonic folk and chorale melodies. The proposed method significantly outperforms comparable state-of-the-art models. I further discuss the free parameters of the learning algorithm and analyze the feature composition of the learned models. The models learned by PULSE afford an easy inspection and are musicologically interpreted for the first time.'},\n",

To regrasp an object in a gripper, a robot pushes the object against external contact/s in the environment such that the external contact keeps the object stationary while the fingers slide over the object. We call this manipulation technique fixtureless fixturing. Exploiting the mechanics of pushing, we characterize a convex polyhedral set of pushes that results in fixtureless fixturing. These pushes are robust against uncertainty in the object inertia, grasping force, and the friction at the contacts. We propose a sampling-based planner that uses the sets of robust pushes to rapidly build a tree of reachable grasps. A path in this tree is a pushing strategy, possibly involving pushes from different sides, to regrasp the object. We demonstrate the experimental validity and robustness of the proposed manipulation technique with different regrasp examples on a manipulation platform. Such a fast and flexible regrasp planner facilitates versatile and flexible automation solutions.'},\n",

       "  'llm_ans': 'Title: Growing length scale accompanying the vitrification: A perspective based on non-singular density fluctuations\\n\\nAbstract: In glass forming liquids close to the glass transition point, even a very slight increase in the macroscopic density results in a dramatic slowing down of the macroscopic relaxation. Concomitantly, the local density itself fluctuates in space. Therefore, one can imagine that even very small local density variations control the local glassy nature. Based on this perspective, a model for describing growing length scale accompanying the vitrification is introduced, in which we assume that in a subsystem whose density is above a certain threshold value, $\\\\rho_{\\\\rm c}$, owing to steric constraints, particle rearrangements are highly suppressed for a sufficiently long time period ($\\\\sim$ structural relaxation time). We regard such a subsystem as a glassy cluster. Then, based on the statistics of the subsystem-density, we predict that with compression (increasing average density $\\\\rho$) at a fixed temperature $T$ in supercooled states, the characteristic length of the clusters, $\\\\xi$, diverges as $\\\\xi\\\\sim(\\\\rho_{\\\\rm c}-\\\\rho)^{-2/d}$, where $d$ is the spatial dimensionality. This $\\\\xi$ measures the average persistence length of the steric constraints in blocking the rearrangement motions and is determined by the subsystem density. Additionally, with decreasing $T$ at a fixed $\\\\rho$, the length scale diverges in the same manner as $\\\\xi\\\\sim(T-T_{\\\\rm c})^{-2/d}$, for which $\\\\rho$ is identical to $\\\\rho_{\\\\rm c}$ at $T=T_{\\\\rm c}$. The exponent describing the diverging length scale is the same as the one predicted by some theoretical models and indeed has been observed in some simulations and experiments. However, the basic mechanism for this divergence is different; that is, we do not invoke thermodynamic anomalies associated with the thermodynamic phase transition as the origin of the growing length scale. We further present arguments for the cooperative properties based on the clusters.\\n\\nThe answer to your question is that with decreasing temperature $T$ at a fixed average density $\\\\rho$, the length scale of the glassy clusters diverges as $\\\\xi\\\\sim(T-T_{\\\\rm c})^{-2/d}$.'},\n",

This work presents a generalization of the classical IQC results of Megretski and Rantzer that leads to a tractable computational procedure for finding exponential rate certificates that are far less conservative than ones computed from $L_2$ gain bounds alone.

Novel contributions include the analysis of infinite dimensional convex minimization problems, allowing the case where minimizers might not exist.

The support of their effective continuous functioning requires automatic screening and permanent optimization with processing of the huge amount of data by high-performance distributed systems. We propose new meta-algorithm of large homogeneous network analysis, its decomposition into alternative sets of loosely connected subnets, and parallel optimization of the most independent elements. This algorithm is based on a network-specific correlation function, Simulated Annealing technique, and is adapted to work in the computer cluster. On the example of large wireless network, we show that proposed algorithm essentially increases speed of parallel optimization. The elaborated general approach can be used for analysis and optimization of the wide range of networks, including such specific types as artificial neural networks or organized in networks physiological systems of living organisms.\\n\\nThe type of problem used to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm is a large wireless network.\\n\\nTitle: Asynchronous Byzantine Machine Learning (the case of SGD)\\n\\nAbstract: Asynchronous distributed machine learning solutions have proven very effective so far, but always assuming perfectly functioning workers. In practice, some of the workers can however exhibit Byzantine behavior, caused by hardware failures, software bugs, corrupt data, or even malicious attacks. We introduce \\\\emph{Kardam}, the first distributed asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that copes with Byzantine workers. Kardam consists of two complementary components: a filtering and a dampening component. The first is scalar-based and ensures resilience against $\\\\frac{1}{3}$ Byzantine workers. Essentially, this filter leverages the Lipschitzness of cost functions and acts as a self-stabilizer against Byzantine workers that would attempt to corrupt the progress of SGD. The dampening component bounds the convergence rate by adjusting to stale information through a generic gradient weighting scheme. We prove that Kardam guarantees almost sure convergence in the presence of asynchrony and Byzantine behavior, and we derive its convergence rate. We evaluate Kardam on the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets and measure its overhead with respect to non Byzantine-resilient solutions. We empirically show that Kardam does not introduce additional noise to the learning procedure but does induce a slowdown (the cost of Byzantine resilience) that we both theoretically and empirically show to be less than $f/n$, where $f$ is the number of Byzantine failures tolerated and $n$ the total number of workers.\\n\\nThe types of problems used to demonstrate the performance of this algorithm are the CIFAR-100 and EMNIST datasets.'},\n",

For example, in chemoinformatics one might want to detect whether a molecule is toxic based on structure and atomic types, or discover the research field of a scientific collaboration network. Existing techniques rely on counting or measuring structural patterns that are known to show large variations from network to network, such as the number of triangles, or the assortativity of node metadata. We introduce the concept of multi-hop assortativity, that captures the similarity of the nodes situated at the extremities of a randomly selected path of a given length. We show that multi-hop assortativity unifies various existing concepts and offers a versatile family of 'fingerprints' to characterize networks. These fingerprints allow in turn to recover the functionalities of a network, with the help of the machine learning toolbox. Our method is evaluated empirically on established social and chemoinformatic network benchmarks. Results reveal that our assortativity based features are competitive providing highly accurate results often outperforming state of the art methods for the network classification task.\"},\n",

In this paper, a Distributed Antenna Power\\nBeacon (DA-PB) based WPT system where these antennas are uniformly distributed\\non a circle is analyzed and optimized with the safety electromagnetic radiation\\nlevel (SERL) requirement.

This called for introducing information sharing, a paradigm in which threat indicators are shared in a community of trust to facilitate defenses. Standards for representation, exchange, and consumption of indicators are proposed in the literature, although various issues are undermined. In this paper, we rethink information sharing for actionable intelligence, by highlighting various issues that deserve further exploration.

Though these steps are fruitful in certain directions and have advanced automation, their singular design focus renders them highly inefficient in achieving AGI. Which set of requirements have to be met in the design of AGI? What are the limits in the design of the artificial? Here, a careful examination of computation in biological systems hints that evolutionary tinkering of contextual processing of information enabled by a hierarchical architecture is the key to build AGI.\"},\n",

A common problem is to predict what a user might do next for the purposes of guidance, recommendation, or prefetching. First-order and higher-order Markov chains have been widely used methods to study such sequences of data. First-order Markov chains are easy to estimate, but lack accuracy when history matters. Higher-order Markov chains, in contrast, have too many parameters and suffer from overfitting the training data. Fitting these parameters with regularization and smoothing only offers mild improvements. In this paper we propose the retrospective higher-order Markov process (RHOMP) as a low-parameter model for such sequences. This model is a special case of a higher-order Markov chain where the transitions depend retrospectively on a single history state instead of an arbitrary combination of history states. There are two immediate computational advantages: the number of parameters is linear in the order of the Markov chain and the model can be fit to large state spaces.

This weakly supervised object localisation problem has been tackled in the past using discriminative models where each object class is localised independently from other classes. We propose a novel framework based on Bayesian joint topic modelling.

Attention-based Natural Language Person Retrieval**\\n\\nAbstract: Following the recent progress in image classification and captioning using deep learning, we develop a novel natural language person retrieval system based on an attention mechanism. More specifically, given the description of a person, the goal is to localize the person in an image. To this end, we first construct a benchmark dataset for natural language person retrieval. To do so, we generate bounding boxes for persons in a public image dataset from the segmentation masks, which are then annotated with descriptions and attributes using the Amazon Mechanical Turk. We then adopt a region proposal network in Faster R-CNN as a candidate region generator. The cropped images based on the region proposals as well as the whole images with attention weights are fed into Convolutional Neural Networks for visual feature extraction, while the natural language expression and attributes are input to Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) models for text feature extraction. The visual and text features are integrated to score region proposals, and the one with the highest score is retrieved as the output of our system. The experimental results show significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method for generic object retrieval and this line of research promises to benefit search in surveillance video footage.'},\n",

Both cross-modal architectures outperformed their baselines (by up to 7.5%) when evaluated on the AVletters dataset.\\n\\nThis research improves upon existing multimodal deep learning techniques by introducing a novel method for performing cross-modality and extending cross-connections, which enables better exploitation of correlations between audio and visual data.'},\n",

These quasi-metametrics, as their names suggest, dispense with one or two standard axioms of metric spaces, specifically distinguishability and symmetry, so that similarity between data points of arbitrary type and form could be measured broadly and effectively. The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features. By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and text extracted via deep learning approaches. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for structured data including categorical and continuous data, the near-metrics corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and images including those extracted from deep learning, the near-metrics derived from normalized and reverse k-step graph diffusion (k very small) exhibit outstanding ability to distinguish data points from different classes.\\n\\n**Method 3:** Distance-based Discriminative Framework\\n\\nTitle: Distance Measure Machines\\n\\nAbstract: This paper presents a distance-based discriminative framework for learning with probability distributions. Instead of using kernel mean embeddings or generalized radial basis kernels, we introduce embeddings based on dissimilarity of distributions to some reference distributions denoted as templates. Our framework extends the theory of similarity of Balcan et al. (2008) to the population distribution case and we show that, for some learning problems, some dissimilarity on distribution achieves low-error linear decision functions with high probability. Our key result is to prove that the theory also holds for empirical distributions. Algorithmically, the proposed approach consists in computing a mapping based on pairwise dissimilarity where learning a linear decision function is amenable. Our experimental results show that the Wasserstein distance embedding performs better than kernel mean embeddings and computing Wasserstein distance is far more tractable than estimating pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence of empirical distributions.\\n\\nI hope these papers are relevant to your research!'},\n",

Furthermore, it must also have a mechanism through which it can keep sensory inputs calibrated to maintain the accuracy of its internal representations. We have developed a neural network architecture capable of i) approximating optimal multisensory spatial integration, based on Bayesian causal inference, and ii) recalibrating the spatial encoding of sensory systems. The architecture is based on features of the dorsal processing hierarchy, including the spatial tuning properties of unisensory neurons and the convergence of different sensory inputs onto multisensory neurons. Furthermore, we propose that these unisensory and multisensory neurons play dual roles in i) encoding spatial location as separate or integrated estimates and ii) accumulating evidence for the independence or relatedness of multisensory stimuli. We further propose that top-down feedback connections spanning the dorsal pathway play key a role in recalibrating spatial encoding at the level of early unisensory cortices. Our proposed architecture provides possible explanations for a number of human electrophysiological and neuroimaging results and generates testable predictions linking neurophysiology with behaviour.\\n\\nThis abstract mentions \"top-down feedback connections\" which could be related to the aspect of the neural architecture that allows for top-down information transfer.

In the absence of hand-crafted reward functions, prior work on the topic has proposed several methods for reward estimation by using expert state trajectories and action pairs. However, there are cases where complete or good action information cannot be obtained from expert demonstrations. We propose a novel reinforcement learning method in which the agent learns an internal model of observation on the basis of expert-demonstrated state trajectories to estimate rewards without completely learning the dynamics of the external environment from state-action pairs. The internal model is obtained in the form of a predictive model for the given expert state distribution. During reinforcement learning, the agent predicts the reward as a function of the difference between the actual state and the state predicted by the internal model. We conducted multiple experiments in environments of varying complexity, including the Super Mario Bros and Flappy Bird games. We show our method successfully trains good policies directly from expert game-play videos.\\n\\nThis paper proposes a method for learning an internal model from observations, which can be used to predict future states and plan accordingly. The internal model is learned based on expert-demonstrated state trajectories and is used to estimate rewards without requiring complete knowledge of the external environment.\"},\n",

In this region, there are no solutions containing any types of isolated solitons to the mean field equations.\\n\\nAccording to this research paper, the fan-type spin structure in uni-axial chiral magnets is similar to that of non-chiral helimagnets (Yoshimori-type), but it is less common in chiral helimagnets.'},\n",

Early debates about the relationship were finally resolved with the advent of a statistical partitioning scheme that decomposed the biodiversity effect into a \"selection\" effect and a \"complementarity\" effect. We prove that both the biodiversity effect and its statistical decomposition into selection and complementarity are fundamentally flawed because these methods use a naïve null expectation based on neutrality, likely leading to an overestimate of the net biodiversity effect, and they fail to account for the nonlinear abundance-ecosystem functioning relationships observed in nature. Furthermore, under such nonlinearity no statistical scheme can be devised to partition the biodiversity effects. We also present an alternative metric providing a more reasonable estimate of biodiversity effect. Our results suggest that all studies conducted since the early 1990s likely overestimated the positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning.'},\n",

By combining bibliometric data from Web of Science and Twitter users identified by Altmetric.com we have obtained the largest set of individual scholars matched with Twitter users made so far. Our methodology consists of a combination of matching algorithms, considering different linguistic elements of both author names and Twitter names; followed by a rule-based scoring system that weights the common occurrence of several elements related with the names, individual elements and activities of both Twitter users and scholars matched.

In this paper, we verify that automated architecture search synergizes with the effect of gradient-based meta learning. We adopt the progressive neural architecture search \\\\cite{liu:pnas_google:DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1712-00559} to find optimal architectures for meta-learners.

To avoid these problems, we first propose to use a discriminative component with stochastic inputs for increased noise flexibility. We show how an efficient Gibbs sampling procedure can marginalize the stochastic inputs when inferring missing labels in this model. Following this, we extend the discriminative component to be fully Bayesian and produce estimates of uncertainty in its parameter values.

This is based on the fact that a fully connected feedforward network with one hidden layer, a certain weight distribution, an activation function, and an infinite number of neurons can be viewed as a mapping into a Hilbert space. We derive the equivalent kernels of MLPs with ReLU or Leaky ReLU activations for all rotationally-invariant weight distributions, generalizing a previous result that required Gaussian weight distributions. Additionally, the Central Limit Theorem is used to show that for certain activation functions, kernels corresponding to layers with weight distributions having $0$ mean and finite absolute third moment are asymptotically universal, and are well approximated by the kernel corresponding to layers with spherical Gaussian weights. In deep networks, as depth increases the equivalent kernel approaches a pathological fixed point, which can be used to argue why training randomly initialized networks can be difficult. Our results also have implications for weight initialization.\\n\\nThis paper discusses the invariance of weight distributions in rectified MLPs and has implications for weight initialization, but it does not specifically discuss the effect of different weight initialization methods on the performance of a neural network on the MNIST task.\"},\n",

This crust is probably\\nviscoelastic, which would alter its rotational response. This response would\\ntranslate into several rotational quantities, i.e. the obliquity, and the\\nlibrations at different frequencies, for which the crustal elasticity reacts\\ndifferently. This study aims at modelling the global response of the\\nviscoelastic crust. For that, I derive the time-dependency of the tensor of\\ninertia, which I combine with the time evolution of the rotational quantities,\\nthanks to an iterative algorithm. This algorithm combines numerical simulations\\nof the rotation with a digital filtering of the resulting tensor of inertia.\\nThe algorithm works very well in the elastic case, provided the problem is not\\nresonant.

The shared bandwidth is divided into K orthogonal channels. In the beginning of each time slot, each user selects a channel and transmits a packet with a certain transmission probability. After each time slot, each user that has transmitted a packet receives a local observation indicating whether its packet was successfully delivered or not (i.e., ACK signal). The objective is a multi-user strategy for accessing the spectrum that maximizes a certain network utility in a distributed manner without online coordination or message exchanges between users. Obtaining an optimal solution for the spectrum access problem is computationally expensive in general due to the large state space and partial observability of the states. To tackle this problem, we develop a novel distributed dynamic spectrum access algorithm based on deep multi-user reinforcement leaning. Specifically, at each time slot, each user maps its current state to spectrum access actions based on a trained deep-Q network used to maximize the objective function. Game theoretic analysis of the system dynamics is developed for establishing design principles for the implementation of the algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance of the algorithm.\\n\\nAdditionally, I also found another relevant paper:\\n\\nTitle: Multi-User Multi-Armed Bandits for Uncoordinated Spectrum Access\\n\\nAbstract: A multi-user multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework is used to develop algorithms for uncoordinated spectrum access. The number of users is assumed to be unknown to each user. A stochastic setting is first considered, where the rewards on a channel are the same for each user. In contrast to prior work, it is assumed that the number of users can possibly exceed the number of channels, and that rewards can be non-zero even under collisions. The proposed algorithm consists of an estimation phase and an allocation phase. It is shown that if every user adopts the algorithm, the system wide regret is constant with time with high probability. The regret guarantees hold for any number of users and channels, in particular, even when the number of users is less than the number of channels. Next, an adversarial multi-user MAB framework is considered, where the rewards on the channels are user-dependent. It is assumed that the number of users is less than the number of channels, and that the users receive zero reward on collision. The proposed algorithm combines the Exp3.P algorithm developed in prior work for single user adversarial bandits with a collision resolution mechanism to achieve sub-linear regret. It is shown that if every user employs the proposed algorithm, the system wide regret is of the order $O(T^\\\\frac{3}{4})$ over a horizon of time $T$. The algorithms in both stochastic and adversarial scenarios are extended to the dynamic case where the number of users in the system evolves over time and are shown to lead to sub-linear regret.'},\n",

We improve over a recent state-of-the-art camera calibration method for traffic surveillance based on two detected vanishing points. More importantly, we propose a novel automatic scene scale inference method. The method is based on matching bounding boxes of rendered 3D models of vehicles with detected bounding boxes in the image. The proposed method can be used from arbitrary viewpoints, since it has no constraints on camera placement. We evaluate our method on the recent comprehensive dataset for speed measurement BrnoCompSpeed. Experiments show that our automatic camera calibration method by detection of two vanishing points reduces error by 50% (mean distance ratio error reduced from 0.18 to 0.09) compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. We also show that our scene scale inference method is more precise, outperforming both state-of-the-art automatic calibration method for speed measurement (error reduction by 86% -- 7.98km/h to 1.10km/h) and manual calibration (error reduction by 19% -- 1.35km/h to 1.10km/h).

Secondly, we design anchor-aware lower bound estimation techniques to compute tighter lower bounds for intermediate search states, which significantly reduce the search spaces of both AStar+ and DFS+. We also propose efficient techniques to compute the lower bounds. Thirdly, based on our unified framework, we contrast AStar+ with DFS+ regarding their time and space complexities, and recommend that AStar+ is better than DFS+ by having a much smaller search space. Extensive empirical studies validate that AStar+ performs better than DFS+, and show that our AStar+-BMa approach outperforms the state-of-the-art technique by more than four orders of magnitude.\\n\\nAdvantages of AStar+: \\n- Has a much smaller search space compared to DFS+\\n- Performs better than DFS+ in extensive empirical studies\\n- Outperforms the state-of-the-art technique by more than four orders of magnitude with AStar+-BMa approach\\n\\nDisadvantages of AStar+: \\n- None mentioned in the abstract\\n\\nAdvantages of DFS+: \\n- Can be used as an alternative approach for GED computation and verification\\n\\nDisadvantages of DFS+: \\n- Has a larger search space compared to AStar+\\n- Performs worse than AStar+ in extensive empirical studies'},\n",

Although, the problem has largely been overcome via carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization, architectures incorporating skip-connections such as highway and resnets perform much better than standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen initialization and batch normalization. In this paper, we identify the shattered gradients problem. Specifically, we show that the correlation between gradients in standard feedforward networks decays exponentially with depth resulting in gradients that resemble white noise whereas, in contrast, the gradients in architectures with skip-connections are far more resistant to shattering, decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets. Finally, we present a new \"looks linear\" (LL) initialization that prevents shattering, with preliminary experiments showing the new initialization allows to train very deep networks without the addition of skip-connections.'},\n",

These quasi-metametrics, as their names suggest, dispense with one or two standard axioms of metric spaces, specifically distinguishability and symmetry, so that similarity between data points of arbitrary type and form could be measured broadly and effectively. The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features. By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and text extracted via deep learning approaches. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for structured data including categorical and continuous data, the near-metrics corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and images including those extracted from deep learning, the near-metrics derived from normalized and reverse k-step graph diffusion (k very small) exhibit outstanding ability to distinguish data points from different classes.\\n\\nThis paper discusses a new family of near-metrics, which can be seen as a relaxation of classical metrics. While classical metrics follow certain axioms (distinguishability and symmetry), these near-metrics dispense with one or two of these axioms to capture similarity between data points in a more flexible way.'},\n",

The model is trained with word vector representations of social media posts, and in order to make a click-through more likely, it is dynamically seeded with topics extracted from the target's timeline. We augment the model with clustering to triage high-value targets based on their level of social engagement, and measure success of the LSTM's phishing expedition using click-rates of IP-tracked links. We achieve state-of-the-art success rates, tripling those of historic email attack campaigns, and outperform humans manually performing the same task.\"},\n",

The well-known Weil's exponential sum theorem presents an upper bound of\\nthe exponential sum over the $p$-set. Based on the result, one shows that the\\n$p$-set performs well in numerical integration, in compressed sensing as well\\nas in UQ. However, $p$-set is somewhat rigid since the cardinality of the\\n$p$-set is a prime $p$ and the set only depends on the prime number $p$. The\\npurpose of this paper is to present generalizations of $p$-sets, say\\n$\\\\mathcal{P}_{d,p}^{{\\\\mathbf a},\\\\epsilon}$, which is more flexible.\\nParticularly, when a prime number $p$ is given, we have many different choices\\nof the new $p$-sets. Under the assumption that Goldbach conjecture holds, for\\nany even number $m$, we present a point set, say ${\\\\mathcal L}_{p,q}$, with\\ncardinality $m-1$ by combining two different new $p$-sets, which overcomes a\\nmajor bottleneck of the $p$-set.

Building upon a global-local framework of prior construction, in which continuous scale mixtures of Gaussian distributions are employed for both desirable shrinkage properties and computational tractability, we model dependence among the local scale parameters. The resulting processes inherit the desirable shrinkage behavior of popular global-local priors, such as the horseshoe prior, but provide additional localized adaptivity, which is important for modeling time series data or regression functions with local features. We construct a computationally efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm based on a Pólya-Gamma scale mixture representation of the proposed process. Using dynamic shrinkage processes, we develop a Bayesian trend filtering model that produces more accurate estimates and tighter posterior credible intervals than competing methods, and apply the model for irregular curve-fitting of minute-by-minute Twitter CPU usage data. In addition, we develop an adaptive time-varying parameter regression model to assess the efficacy of the Fama-French five-factor asset pricing model with momentum added as a sixth factor. Our dynamic analysis of manufacturing and healthcare industry data shows that with the exception of the market risk, no other risk factors are significant except for brief periods.\\n\\nThis model is unique because it provides more accurate estimates and tighter posterior credible intervals compared to competing methods.'},\n",

This motivates the need for a real-time, probabilistic forecasting algorithm for pedestrians, cyclists, and other agents since these predictions will form a necessary step in assessing the risk of any action. This paper presents a novel approach to probabilistic forecasting for pedestrians based on weighted sums of ordinary differential equations that are learned from historical trajectory information within a fixed scene. The resulting algorithm is embarrassingly parallel and is able to work at real-time speeds using a naive Python implementation. The quality of predicted locations of agents generated by the proposed algorithm is validated on a variety of examples and considerably higher than existing state of the art approaches over long time horizons.\"},\n",

The functional is shown to be predictive up to densities\\n$\\\\sim0.01$ fm$^{-3}$ that is much higher densities compared to the Lee-Yang\\nfunctional, valid for $\\\\rho < 10^{-6}$ fm$^{-3}$. The form of the functional\\nretained in this work is further motivated. It is shown that the new functional\\ncorresponds to an expansion of the energy in $(a_s k_F)$ and $(r_e k_F)$ to all\\norders, where $r_e$ is the effective range and $k_F$ is the Fermi momentum. One\\nconclusion from the present work is that, except in the extremely low--density\\nregime, nuclear systems can be treated perturbatively in $-(a_s k_F)^{-1}$ with\\nrespect to the unitary limit. Starting from the functional, we introduce\\ndensity--dependent scales and show that scales associated to the bare\\ninteraction are strongly renormalized by medium effects. As a consequence, some\\nof the scales at play around saturation are dominated by the unitary gas\\nproperties and not directly to low-energy constants. For instance, we show that\\nthe scale in the s-wave channel around saturation is proportional to the\\nso-called Bertsch parameter $\\\\xi_0$ and becomes independent of $a_s$. We also\\npoint out that these scales are of the same order of magnitude than those\\nempirically obtained in the Skyrme energy density functional. We finally\\npropose a slight modification of the functional such that it becomes accurate\\nup to the saturation density $\\\\rho\\\\simeq 0.16$ fm$^{-3}$.'},\n",

Our neural network takes monocular RGB images and the instance segmentation mask of a specified target object as inputs, and predicts the probability of successfully grasping the specified object for each candidate motor command. The proposed transfer learning framework trains a model for instance grasping in simulation and uses a domain-adversarial loss to transfer the trained model to real robots using indiscriminate grasping data, which is available both in simulation and the real world. We evaluate our model in real-world robot experiments, comparing it with alternative model architectures as well as an indiscriminate grasping baseline.'},\n",

A convolutional neural network is trained on a collection of discrete, parameterizable fluid simulation velocity fields. Due to the capability of deep learning architectures to learn representative features of the data, our generative model is able to accurately approximate the training data set, while providing plausible interpolated in-betweens. The proposed generative model is optimized for fluids by a novel loss function that guarantees divergence-free velocity fields at all times. In addition, we demonstrate that we can handle complex parameterizations in reduced spaces, and advance simulations in time by integrating in the latent space with a second network. Our method models a wide variety of fluid behaviors, thus enabling applications such as fast construction of simulations, interpolation of fluids with different parameters, time re-sampling, latent space simulations, and compression of fluid simulation data. Reconstructed velocity fields are generated up to 700x faster than traditional CPU solvers, while achieving compression rates of over 1300x.\\n\\nIn this paper, the authors demonstrate that a neural network trained on a generative model can be used for tasks such as:\\n\\n* Fast construction of simulations\\n* Interpolation of fluids with different parameters\\n* Time re-sampling\\n* Latent space simulations\\n* Compression of fluid simulation data\\n\\nThese tasks go beyond inference and showcase the capabilities of generative models in various applications.'},\n",

Here, we show that a major bottleneck for fitting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to neural data is the estimation of the individual receptive field locations, a problem that has been scratched only at the surface thus far. We propose a CNN architecture with a sparse readout layer factorizing the spatial (where) and feature (what) dimensions. Our network scales well to thousands of neurons and short recordings and can be trained end-to-end. We evaluate this architecture on ground-truth data to explore the challenges and limitations of CNN-based system identification. Moreover, we show that our network model outperforms current state-of-the-art system identification models of mouse primary visual cortex.'},\n",

In this paper a new dam breach modeling framework is introduced that shall improve the reliability of hydrograph predictions of homogeneous earthen embankment dams. Striving for a small number of parameters, the simplified physics-based model describes the processes of failing embankment dams by breach enlargement, driven by progressive surface erosion. Therein the erosion rate of dam material is modeled by empirical sediment transport formulations. Embedding the model into a Bayesian multilevel framework allows for quantitative analysis of different categories of uncertainties. To this end, data available in literature of observed peak discharge and final breach width of historical dam failures was used to perform model inversion by applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. Prior knowledge is mainly based on non-informative distribution functions. The resulting posterior distribution shows that the main source of uncertainty is a correlated subset of parameters, consisting of the residual error term and the epistemic term quantifying the breach erosion rate. The prediction intervals of peak discharge and final breach width are congruent with values known from literature. To finally predict the outflow hydrograph for real case applications, an alternative residual model was formulated that assumes perfect data and a perfect model.

Such a method is well justified in the full plane, thanks to the explicit representation formulas of Biot and Savart. In an exterior domain, we also replace the impermeable boundary by a collection of point vortices generating the circulation around the obstacle. The density of these point vortices is chosen in order that the flow remains tangent at midpoints between adjacent vortices. In this work, we provide a rigorous justification for this method in exterior domains. One of the main mathematical difficulties being that the Biot-Savart kernel defines a singular integral operator when restricted to a curve. For simplicity and clarity, we only treat the case of the unit disk in the plane approximated by a uniformly distributed mesh of point vortices.
